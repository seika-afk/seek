1. Web Crawling :
    1- Web Crawl according to a query/link ,
        a. take query and seed link
    2.then first gather the list of links to be crawled later, 
        a. store list of links
    3.then find the text in the crawled webpage ,if there -> list else move on 
        a. fetch HTML -> Clean that shi , 
        b. Meaningful text exists -> store in index
        c. if empty --> skip 
        d. stop after threshold

"Meaningful text exists"
bm25 scoring 
tfidf+cosine similarity

"store in index"
- inverted index
- okapi mb25
- tfidf


(|a|)query-> fetch page-> extract all links-> put in index
                -> compute relevancy to query (tfidf,bm25,cosine similarity)
                ->relevant -> store in index 
                -> non relevant-> skip
then query the left links
