And I get that \u2014 I have the same desire.\nBut as someone who has put in a ton of very productive days (in addition to (ahem) less productive ones) \u2026 I\u2019ve found that just being productive can feel very meaningless.\nImagine cranking away at all of your tasks, knocking them off, day after day. The task list doesn\u2019t grow shorter, the email inbox keeps filling up, your calendar only gets more full as you get better at replying to people\u2019s emails. So you crank away even harder, and your Done list looks impressive each day.\nSatisfying? Sure, a bit. It can feel good to be focused and check things off the list. But it doesn\u2019t feel very meaningful after a while. It feels like an endless hamster wheel \u2014 pointless. I\u2019m far from the first person to make this observation. And yet \u2026 we\u2019re often still striving for that as a goal.\nI\u2019d like to propose a different framework: meaningful days, not (only) productive ones. (And btw, if you\u2019d like to substitute a different adjective, like \u201calive\u201d or \u201cjoyful\u201d or \u201cmagical,\u201d go for it!)\nWhat would make our days meaningful, and not just productive? Well, that\u2019s for you to discover, of course. I don\u2019t determine your meaning.\nThat said, here are some things that help me create meaningful days:\n\n\nSet an intention: to have meaningful days. Remind myself of this focus at different times of the day.\n\n\nPlan for meaning: what projects, tasks and work with others will feel meaningful? Block that into the calendar each day and each week.\n\n\nExperiment to find what feels meaningful: As I do different kind of work, as myself if this feels pointless or meaningful. I find that doing things that serve others is a big one, as is creating community, taking care of myself and my loved ones, and doing things that feel expansive. But I\u2019m still exploring!\n\n\nFind meaning during, and after: As I\u2019m doing the task, or the call, or responding to an email \u2026 I can look for what\u2019s meaningful in that moment. Is there some way that I\u2019m helping someone? Am I trying to make the world better? Does this feel expansive, loving, generous, compassionate? After the task, if I forgot to notice the meaning during the task, I can reflect on what made it meaningful. I might not do this all the time, but when I do, it helps.\n\n\nReconnect to the meaning when I\u2019ve lost it: For a certain task or project, I will often lose track of why something is meaningful, and just try to do it because I think I should. When I recognize this \u2014 I\u2019m just trying to get through it \u2014 I can try to reconnect to the meaning. I often have to do this multiple times, but also I often forget!\n\n\nPractice opening my heart: For me, if my heart is open, it\u2019s meaningful. What does that mean? Imagine how you feel when you give someone a generous gift and it lights them up, or you see a loved one having a nice moment, or you see a sunset that knocks you on your butt. That\u2019s how an open heart feels. You feel loving, you feel open, you feel generous and grateful. I\u2019ve found that I can practice opening my heart in any moment, increasing the meaning of that activity.\n\n\nBe more appreciative of the spaces between: It\u2019s not just the tasks that make a day meaningful \u2014 often it makes a huge difference if I pause and notice nature, and other people, and just notice what feels meaningful to me even when I\u2019m not being productive. Am I enjoying a nice break, a nice walk, a good book, a nap, a good meal? That matters too. In the end, these aren\u2019t the answers that will create meaning for you \u2014 but you might try them!

We want you to think it\u2019s a real website and when you forward the link to someone we don\u2019t want you to say, \u201cCheck out this guy\u2019s blog\u201d cause then it seems like it\u2019s just this guy writing and it\u2019s just a blog.  We want you to say, \u201cCheck out this site\u201d cause then we seem like a bigger deal and it seems like a legit thing.  Okay?\nDo you guys have jobs?\nMaybe you should spend less time asking us judgmental questions and more time realizing that you\u2019re on question 3 of an FAQ page on a procrastination website.\nAre you writing Wait But Why to distract yourself from the fact of your own mortality?\nChrist.  Yeah, probably that is deep down a bit of what\u2019s happening.  What the hell kind of question is that?\nIt just seemed likely.\nOkay.\nAnything else?\nNo.  Is there a reason we\u2019re still here?\nOh if you\u2019re ready to leave, by all means let\u2019s leave.

Here\u2019s how to reach us:\nGeneral Questions or Feedback, or Business-Related: Contact[at]waitbutwhy.com\nTim Urban: Tim[at]waitbutwhy.com\nAndrew Finn: Andrew[at]waitbutwhy.com\nAlicia McElhone: Alicia[at]waitbutwhy.com\nSpeaking inquiries: Speaking[at]waitbutwhy.com\nStore-Related Questions: Shop[at]waitbutwhy.com\n \nHere\u2019s the deal with getting responses back from us:\nFor business-related emails\u2014things about partnerships or translations or re-distribution or permissions, etc., we\u2019ll try to be back to you within 24 hours (unless we suspect that you emailed us as part of a mass or form email, in which case we\u2019ll probably not respond). If you\u2019re trying to reach us for business purposes and haven\u2019t heard back in a couple days, please email again\u2014your email either got lost in the shuffle or each person on our end thought someone else was responding to it.\nFor store-related emails\u2014same 24-hour rule, and same \u201ctry again if you don\u2019t hear back\u201d advice.\nFor content-related emails\u2014everything from praise to constructive feedback to good old fashion hate mail to your own musings about the world to a funny joke to an unfunny joke to your procrastination goals to anything else you want to email us about. Here\u2019s the situation:\n1) Email us. We love getting your emails, and I promise you this\u2014whoever you email (the \u201ccontact\u201d email for both of us or the individual \u201ctim\u201d or \u201candrew\u201d emails for one of us) will read your email, every single time. Sometimes they back up and it takes a while, but neither of us is yet to archive an email without reading it.\n2) You may or may not hear back from us, depending on a lot of things. We\u2019re lucky to receive a whole lot of emails, and while that really makes us happy, it\u2019s no longer realistic to promise a response to all of them. Sure, we could write back a one-word response or a uniform canned response or hire someone to respond for us\u2014but those are all kind of inauthentic and shitty ways to respond to what are almost always thoughtful reach-outs from the people who appreciate the site the most. We\u2019d rather do this\u2014whenever it\u2019s a down day or there\u2019s a week off from posting, we\u2019ll do whatever we can to catch up on responses, and sometimes an email comes in just as we\u2019re in a good place to respond and you\u2019ll hear back right away. Other times, you\u2019ll hear back eight months later and you\u2019ll have forgotten that you ever sent the email and it\u2019ll be weird. But right now, the backlog of need-a-response emails is in the thousands, and there\u2019s just not enough time to get to all of them. And if you never hear back, know that you were absolutely not ignored.\nYou can also try to contact us through the Wait But Why Facebook or Twitter pages or through our personal social media accounts if you\u2019re a dedicated-enough stalker, but these are all less likely to get a response than emailing the WBW email addresses.\nFinally, you can contact us in a whole other way by commenting on the blog posts, either on the comment sections below each post or on the Wait But Why Facebook posts. We read each and every one of these too, and this is a great way to engage with us and the other Wait But Why readers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe AI Revolution\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 22, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1,176\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhy Procrastinators Procrastinate\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 30, 2013\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t599\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Fermi Paradox\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMay 21, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1,429\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow (and Why) SpaceX Will Colonize Mars\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAugust 16, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t992\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow to Pick a Life Partner\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 12, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t319\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhy Gen Y Yuppies Are Unhappy\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSeptember 9, 2013\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1,245\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPutting Time In Perspective\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAugust 22, 2013\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t568\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow to Name a Baby\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember 11, 2013\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t333\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhy You Should Stop Caring What Other People Think\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 13, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t367\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReligion for the Nonreligious\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 19, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t850\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Tail End\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember 11, 2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t321\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom Muhammad to ISIS: Iraq's Full Story\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSeptember 12, 2014\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t329\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Posts\n\n\nThe sights and sounds of Bhutan\n\n\nTales from Toddlerhood\n\n\nEndnotes\n\n\nWhy I Lugged My 27-Pound Toddler to a Rocket Launch\n\n\nThe 2024 Trump-Biden Debate\n\n\nTales From the Eclipse\n\n\nAll My Thoughts After 40 Hours in the Vision Pro\n\n\nThe Ant-Honey Problem\n\n\n10 Thoughts from the Fourth Trimester\n\n\nIdea Labs Opt-Out\n\n\n \n\nLinksHomepage\nabout\n\nwait but who\nfaq\ncontact\n\n\narchive\nminis\nthe shed\ndinner table\nstore\n\nstore home\nnew releases\nposters\nphone cases\ncards & wrapping paper\nsquishy things\nmen\u2019s tees\nwomen\u2019s tees\ncoffee mugs\nstore support\n\n\nsupport wbw\nbook\n#7246 (no title)\nFinn\u2019s Cave\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 WaitButWhy 2026\nContactPartner With UsPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He's with you at night. He's probably with you right now as you read this. So you might as well just learn to cuddle with him. And when he's really ruining your life, you can pick him up and slam him to the ground, or put him in the closet, or wring his little neck, as a reminder that this is your life and not his, goddammit.\nFrom the post:\u00a0Why Procrastinators Procrastinate\n\nThe Mammoth\nWe all have a Social Survival Mammoth in our heads, and now you can hold one in your hands, or, if you must, thoroughly snuggle with it. In the\u00a0mammoth post, we talked about our goal: to tame the mammoth so he goes from being a lumbering powerhouse to an adorable little pet. This plush toy mammoth is your reminder of how seriously we should be taking the mammoths in our heads.\n\nThe Panic Monster\nYou're a procrastinator and the Panic Monster is coming to get you. This squishy, more adorable version of the real thing can serve as a warning, a reminder of what's going to happen if you don't get your shit together on whatever it is you're supposed to be doing.\u00a0\n\n  Posters   \u00a0\n \n      \n Life Calendar (24in x 36in) \n\n  Quick View\n\n     Notify me when this product is available:       Calendar Pack  1 Calendar 3 Pack 5 Pack 10 Pack 20

He's with you at night. He's probably with you right now as you read this. So you might as well just learn to cuddle with him. And when he's really ruining your life, you can pick him up and slam him to the ground, or put him in the closet, or wring his little neck, as a reminder that this is your life and not his, goddammit.\nFrom the post:\u00a0Why Procrastinators Procrastinate\n\nThe Mammoth\nWe all have a Social Survival Mammoth in our heads, and now you can hold one in your hands, or, if you must, thoroughly snuggle with it. In the\u00a0mammoth post, we talked about our goal: to tame the mammoth so he goes from being a lumbering powerhouse to an adorable little pet. This plush toy mammoth is your reminder of how seriously we should be taking the mammoths in our heads.\n\nThe Panic Monster\nYou're a procrastinator and the Panic Monster is coming to get you. This squishy, more adorable version of the real thing can serve as a warning, a reminder of what's going to happen if you don't get your shit together on whatever it is you're supposed to be doing.\u00a0\n\n  Posters   \u00a0\n \n      \n Life Calendar (24in x 36in) \n\n  Quick View\n\n     Notify me when this product is available:       Calendar Pack  1 Calendar 3 Pack 5 Pack 10 Pack 20

For those who want to support Wait But Why, thank you! We exist only because of reader support (there are no ads on the site cause ads are gross), and your support goes a long way. Wait But Why is free and will always be free. And you\u2019re allowed to leave this page and reject the concept of supporting the site. We still like you. If you\u2019d like to help us keep doing what we do, there are five great ways:\n1) Spread the word.\u00a0A free way to help us in a\u00a0massive\u00a0way is to simply tell your friends about the site and share our articles on social media.\n2) Make a small monthly pledge through Patreon.\u00a0Patreon is a service made for this exact situation.\u00a0You can click the button below to see our page and my video explainer:\n\n\nWBW ON PATREON\n\n\n3) Make a one-time donation below or through PayPal. If monthly pledges aren\u2019t your thing, normal donation works great too.\n\n\n4) Check out our store. Buy something if you like what\u2019s there (or send us feedback about what should be there if you don\u2019t like anything).\n5) Subscribe. The best way for a blog to grow a long-lasting readership is with email subscriptions. Plus, it\u2019s easier than having to remember to come back to the site again and again or guess exactly when Tim will post each new article. We know how overloaded everyone\u2019s inbox is, so we treat our email list like gold, sending an email only when there\u2019s a new post and almost never for any other reason (and of course, we\u2019d never share your email with anyone).

But in the middle of 2016, I started thinking about a new topic: why my society sucked. As technology soared ahead, it seemed like we were going backwards in wisdom. Tribalism was flaring up everywhere, mass shaming campaigns were roaring back into fashion, politicians were increasingly clown-like, public discourse had become a battle of one-dimensional narratives. I decided to write about it, which plunged me into a rabbit hole like no other. Six years later, I emerged with this book. The book introduces a new framework for thinking about our complex political environment. With dozens of new terms and concepts and 303 drawings, it\u2019s a toolbox for understanding our societies, our group dynamics, and our own minds. Here\u2019s everything on all the pages:\n\n\n\n\nSee how much shit is in there? That took a really long time and I\u2019m happy it\u2019s over. Anyway, stop procrastinating by reading all the way down on this page and go read the book, and then we can discuss.\nThe full story behind the making of this book | Wait But Why homepage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAboutArchiveMinisThe ShedDinner TableStoreSupport WBW\n\u00a9 All Rights Reserved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The top 1% make about the same total income as the bottom 40% combined, which is significant, but it is nothing compared to the wealth gap. \nThe top 1% have 139x as much wealth as the bottom 40%.\nSo, why are income and capital gains tax rates based on income, not wealth?\u00a0This is an outdated and oversimplistic way to ballpark wealth, and modern technology makes it much easier for track wealth now than in the past.\u00a0\nIf we want to devise a more sensible tax system, we should strongly consider basing income and capital tax rates on a metric I will call Liquid Net Worth, instead of the traditional \u201ctaxable income\u201d. This ensures that tax rates are assessed on a more full picture of someone\u2019s financial situation, not just their year-to-year income.\n Continue reading \u201cLiquid Net Worth may be a Better Basis than Income for Income Tax\u00a0Rates\u201d\nShare this:\nShare on X (Opens in new window)\nX\n\nShare on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook\n\nEmail a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\nEmail\n\nShare on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn\nLike Loading... \n\nAuthor  Andrew FinnPosted on June 23, 2017June 23, 2017Categories Andrew Posts, Entrepreneurship, Uncategorized11 Comments on Liquid Net Worth may be a Better Basis than Income for Income Tax\u00a0Rates \n\n\n\nGovernment to Business \u2013 \u201cRobots, Not Humans, are the Workers You\u00a0Want\u201d \n\n\u00a0\nEver since sharing economy companies burst on to the scene, there have been disputes between governments, like the State of California, and companies, like Uber, about the\u00a0employee/contractor classification of its workers.\nSome companies surrendered (Instacart), a few\u00a0are still fighting (Uber), and some had to shut their doors because of the changes (Homejoy).\nNone of these policies are good for the long-term of labor in America. They\u00a0massively discourage entrepreneurs from building business that revolve around human workers, and they accelerate the transition to a job-lite world that is built on robot, not human, labor.\n Continue reading \u201cGovernment to Business \u2013 \u201cRobots, Not Humans, are the Workers You\u00a0Want\u201d\u201d\nShare this:\nShare on X (Opens in new window)\nX\n\nShare on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook\n\nEmail a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\nEmail\n\nShare on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn\nLike Loading... \n\nAuthor  Andrew FinnPosted on June 5, 2017June 6, 2017Categories Andrew Posts, Entrepreneurship, Tech, Uncategorized5 Comments on Government to Business \u2013 \u201cRobots, Not Humans, are the Workers You\u00a0Want\u201d \n\n\n\nEverest Base Camp, Type 2 Fun, and Apocolypse\u00a0Draft \n\nI was fortunate enough to trek to Everest Base Camp this month, and I wrote this up about my experience.\nIt was mainly for friends and family and isn\u2019t my tightest piece of writing, but I thought I\u2019d post it on Finn\u2019s Cave, because fck it, if you\u2019re procrastinating so hard that you\u2019re reading Finn\u2019s Cave, you\u2019re might be interested in this account.\n Continue reading \u201cEverest Base Camp, Type 2 Fun, and Apocolypse\u00a0Draft\u201d\nShare this:\nShare on X (Opens in new window)\nX\n\nShare on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook\n\nEmail a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\nEmail\n\nShare on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn\nLike Loading... \n\nAuthor  Andrew FinnPosted on April 25, 2017April 25, 2017Categories Andrew Posts, Everest Base Camp, Travel, Uncategorized6 Comments on Everest Base Camp, Type 2 Fun, and Apocolypse\u00a0Draft \n\n\nPosts pagination\nPage 1\nPage 2\nNext page\n\n\n\n\nAbout Investing in self-funded search and independent sponsor deals at G64 Ventures.\nCo-built Wait But Why & ArborBridge (acq), bought/holding CollegePlannerPro & Apartment Guardian\nHere to share learnings from my first 15 years of entrepreneurship in hopes it will be useful for folks just starting out. \nNot an expert, just a fan of dogs and golf who has been to a few business places and has $.02 to give. \n\nView finnscave\u2019s profile on TwitterLinkedIn andrew@g64ventures.com www.g64ventures.com\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nYou, Inc \u2013 Getting Into\u00a0Business  Wake up every day, consumed by \u201cYou, Inc\u201d. \n\n\n\n\nEntrepreneurial Motivations: Light and Shadow\u00a0Forces The best reason to start a company is to solve a problem that you genuinely, to your core, care about, and you can\u2019t see another way to\u2026\n\n\n\n\nBuild Your Company to\u00a0Exit If your long-term goal is to move from labor to capital, then you need to build your business into an asset that you can personally \u201cexit\u201d, not\u2026\n\n\n\n\nThe Secret Sauce of Valuable Service\u00a0Businesses Robert Smith of Vista Equity Partners famously said, \u201cSoftware companies taste like chicken.

In the time since then, it has somehow avoided being annexed by China or India. Today, it is the world\u2019s last Buddhist kingdom, and I can confirm that it is both very Buddhist and very kingdom-y. Temples are everywhere, and the people are highly superstitious\u2014our tour guide seemed to constantly be remarking about good luck and bad luck, promising omens and inauspicious riverbends.

A typical story we heard: 50,000 people work in the country\u2019s tourist industry, all of whom were suddenly out of work during Covid. So the king gave these families $120/month, enough to get by on until the industry came back. He paid this out of his own pocket, nearly to the point of personal bankruptcy.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"360\" height=\"564\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/tigersnest.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10794\" style=\"width:363px;height:auto\"/></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>(Of course, I was also told <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/09/20-things-i-learned-while-i-was-in.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">in North Korea</a> that it was only by the grace and courage of their magnanimous leaders that the people were prosperous and free, unlike their unfortunate South Korean cousins suffering under American occupation.

They mostly live off the detritus of restaurants and hotels. When everything shut down during Covid, the king told people to bring cooked food out to the dogs and even wrap them in blankets during the cold months.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Bhutan does things differently than other countries. Hellbent on preserving their traditional way of life, TV and internet were banned in the country until 1999, and if it weren\u2019t for the cars, I might have been convinced I had taken a time machine back to the 1600s. Tourism is limited, only possible in the form of a guided tour, and immigrating to the country is near impossible. They are so diligent about conservation that Bhutan is the world\u2019s one carbon-negative country\u2014their vast forests absorb more CO<sub>2</sub> than their populace emits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1972, Bhutan\u2019s king decided that Gross National Happiness was a more important metric than Gross Domestic Product, and their policies cater to this value.<a href=\"#footnote-2-10774\" id=\"note-2-10774\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a> It&#8217;s why Bhutan is famous for supposedly being the world&#8217;s happiest country, which I had no way to verify, but the people were very kind and seemed pretty happy I guess?</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, Bhutan\u2019s way of life is threatened now as many of its young people have left to find opportunity elsewhere. The king is attempting to fix this with plans to construct <a href=\"https://gmc.bt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gelephu Mindfulness City</a>, an economic hub which will center around innovation, while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuoctvOe1OE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">preserving Bhutanese tradition</a>. It looks like it\u2019ll be incredible, though I was told not to hold my breath as it will probably not be finished for 20 more years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this is to say that Bhutan is a special place\u2014remote, mysterious, and breathtakingly beautiful.

I\u2019m not here to talk about the new baby, delightful and obese as she may be. Today, I report to you from the depths of toddler parenthood. I always thought two-year-olds were basically unconscious blobs with a cold, but it turns out they\u2019re actual people you can get to know. Having now spent some time cohabitating with one, I\u2019ve made the following discoveries:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-you-can-be-simultaneously-completely-obsessed-with-and-dramatically-bored-by-the-same-person\"><strong>1) You can be simultaneously completely obsessed with and dramatically bored by the same person.</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes when I\u2019m working in my office, my daughter will toddle in, run over to me, and give me a hug. It is by far the best part of my day. Her smile fills me with utter joy. Her little voice is sent straight from heaven. I feel the purest possible love for her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s just that I also find her groundbreakingly boring. A five-minute hangout is one thing, but when I\u2019m deep in an afternoon with her, it\u2019s hard to come to any other conclusion than that I\u2019ve spent my last three hours with a person whose IQ is 20.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure data-wp-context=\"{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;6991ffe3333d5&quot;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core/image\" data-wp-key=\"6991ffe3333d5\" class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized wp-lightbox-container\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"857\" height=\"461\" data-wp-class--hide=\"state.isContentHidden\" data-wp-class--show=\"state.isContentVisible\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/3-cow-says-moo.png\" alt=\"toddler: The cow says moo! parent, lying on ground: It does.\" class=\"wp-image-10674\" style=\"width:467px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/3-cow-says-moo.png 857w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/3-cow-says-moo-600x323.png 600w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/3-cow-says-moo-750x403.png 750w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/3-cow-says-moo-768x413.png 768w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/3-cow-says-moo-374x200.png 374w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/3-cow-says-moo-239x130.png 239w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 857px) 100vw, 857px\" /><button\n\t\t\tclass=\"lightbox-trigger\"\n\t\t\ttype=\"button\"\n\t\t\taria-haspopup=\"dialog\"\n\t\t\taria-label=\"Enlarge\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-init=\"callbacks.initTriggerButton\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-on--click=\"actions.showLightbox\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--right=\"state.imageButtonRight\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--top=\"state.imageButtonTop\"\n\t\t>\n\t\t\t<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"12\" height=\"12\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\">\n\t\t\t\t<path fill=\"#fff\" d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" />\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-toddlers-are-dicks\"><strong>2) Toddlers are dicks.</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s well-known that toddlers transform into mid-20<sup>th</sup>-century totalitarian dictators at the drop of a hat.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure data-wp-context=\"{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;6991ffe33384a&quot;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core/image\" data-wp-key=\"6991ffe33384a\" class=\"wp-block-image size-full wp-lightbox-container\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1514\" height=\"705\" data-wp-class--hide=\"state.isContentHidden\" data-wp-class--show=\"state.isContentVisible\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/4-stalin-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10729\" srcset=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/4-stalin-1.png 1514w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/4-stalin-1-600x279.png 600w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/4-stalin-1-750x349.png 750w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/4-stalin-1-768x358.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1514px) 100vw, 1514px\" /><button\n\t\t\tclass=\"lightbox-trigger\"\n\t\t\ttype=\"button\"\n\t\t\taria-haspopup=\"dialog\"\n\t\t\taria-label=\"Enlarge\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-init=\"callbacks.initTriggerButton\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-on--click=\"actions.showLightbox\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--right=\"state.imageButtonRight\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--top=\"state.imageButtonTop\"\n\t\t>\n\t\t\t<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"12\" height=\"12\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\">\n\t\t\t\t<path fill=\"#fff\" d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" />\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But they\u2019re dicks in less obvious ways too.

It makes no sense to me that toddlers just learn a language by hearing the language, but somehow they do. They\u2019re weird freak geniuses. But then she says stuff like \u201cwould you like a strawberry?\u201d when she wants a strawberry, because when we say \u201cyou,\u201d it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-q-3fPYw_Y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">refers to her</a>, so she now thinks \u201cyou\u201d is a synonym for her name, which is very unimpressive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, the other day I read her a new book for the first time, and then the second time I read it to her, she stopped me in the middle to correct something I said. It turns out I had accidentally skipped a word, which she knew because she somehow memorized the whole book on the first read. But then we\u2019ll pick up another book and she\u2019ll stare at the page for a million years looking for where Curious George is \u201chiding\u201d even though he\u2019s obviously right the fuck there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-6-toddlers-have-a-highly-inaccurate-worldview\"><strong>6) Toddlers have a highly inaccurate worldview.</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We sometimes take our toddler to story time at the library, where the librarian reads a book to a bunch of kids. The first time we took her, she decided to take matters into her own hands and, mid-story, went and sat in the librarian\u2019s lap. The issue is that she hadn\u2019t quite figured out that the world does not exist entirely for her benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s understandable. You\u2019re born into the world and for the first few years, everyone you see smiles and waves at you, so you overestimate your importance. Only slowly do you learn what\u2019s really happening.<a href=\"#footnote-3-10661\" id=\"note-3-10661\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a>\n\n\n\n<figure data-wp-context=\"{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;6991ffe33504a&quot;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core/image\" data-wp-key=\"6991ffe33504a\" class=\"wp-block-image size-full wp-lightbox-container\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1280\" height=\"439\" data-wp-class--hide=\"state.isContentHidden\" data-wp-class--show=\"state.isContentVisible\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/9-spectrum-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10761\" srcset=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/9-spectrum-4.png 1280w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/9-spectrum-4-600x206.png 600w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/9-spectrum-4-750x257.png 750w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/9-spectrum-4-768x263.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /><button\n\t\t\tclass=\"lightbox-trigger\"\n\t\t\ttype=\"button\"\n\t\t\taria-haspopup=\"dialog\"\n\t\t\taria-label=\"Enlarge\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-init=\"callbacks.initTriggerButton\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-on--click=\"actions.showLightbox\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--right=\"state.imageButtonRight\"\n\t\t\tdata-wp-style--top=\"state.imageButtonTop\"\n\t\t>\n\t\t\t<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"12\" height=\"12\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\">\n\t\t\t\t<path fill=\"#fff\" d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" />\n\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t</button></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is part of the broader phenomenon of a toddler not really having any idea what\u2019s going on. They don\u2019t know about death, or money, or history, or sex, or the Big Bang, or basically anything about reality. They just emerged out of nowhere and started being, which for some reason doesn\u2019t strike them as weird or confusing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(A good \u201cdo you have any idea what\u2019s going on?\u201d litmus test is: If you\u2019re walking down the street and an elephant flies down from the sky, hovers ten feet above you and says hello in a silly cartoon voice before flying off, would you be like \u201cOH MY GOD WHAT JUST HAPPENED\u201d or would you shrug and be like \u201cI guess that\u2019s something that happens\u201d? If the latter, you have no idea what\u2019s going on.

Once when she dropped something, I said \u201ckerplunk,\u201d and she found it fucking hilarious. For the next ten minutes, she kept picking things up, dropping them, and saying \u201ckerplunk,\u201d hysterically laughing each time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But unintentionally, she\u2019s a comedic genius. When I was in her way recently, she said, \u201cCan you get out of space?\u201d which my wife and I now say to each other whenever we want the other to move. Another time, we had to rip a band-aid off her leg, after which she said, \u201cI am so perfectly sad,\u201d and now my wife and I say that anytime we\u2019re unhappy about something.<a href=\"#footnote-4-10661\" id=\"note-4-10661\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve also discovered an amazing hack: you can just teach a toddler to say whatever you want.

In the last week, life has gotten weird.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  My journey to the Haleakal\u0101 shield volcano Austin coffee shop began more than 30 years ago, in 1990, when my parents brought me to something called a \u201cvirtual reality exhibit\u201d at the Seaport World Trade Center in Boston. I stood on a little circular pedestal, and the guy handed me a plastic gun and put a big headset on me. Suddenly I was in some cartoon world, in a military uniform, holding a real gun. The person on the pedestal next to me was there, also a cartoon, also holding a gun. After some janky waving and shooting, they kicked me out for the next person in line. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  I had recently read <em>The Phantom Tollbooth</em>, where a kid in the real world crosses a magic threshold and enters a cartoon world.<em> </em>This felt like that. I wanted more.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Then VR disappeared for 25 years. Throughout the \u201890s and 2000s, \u201cvirtual reality\u201d was a forgotten dream\u2014a cool concept that never made it. But in the mid-2010s, VR made an unexpected comeback. 20-year-old Palmer Luckey\u2019s duct-taped headset prototype had impressed enough investors for Oculus to become a real company. In 2014, Facebook bought Oculus. Google and Sony got involved. It was all finally happening.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>   In 2016, I decided to write about the VR revolution. I went around Silicon Valley, interviewing people at Google and Facebook to get the full scoop on VR. I even sat down with Mark Zuckerberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Zuck.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1139\" height=\"797\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Zuck.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10477\" style=\"width:600px\" srcset=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Zuck.png 1139w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Zuck-600x420.png 600w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Zuck-750x525.png 750w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Zuck-768x537.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1139px) 100vw, 1139px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  I demoed everything. It was mind-blowing. VR was about to take over the world. And I was gonna be the one to tell everyone.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Then two things happened:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>\n  VR didn\u2019t take over the world.\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>   I didn\u2019t write a VR post because I fell into a six-year <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/whatsourproblem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">book</a> hole instead. </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>   From the bottom of my book hole, I kept following the story. At Facebook\u2019s 2016 developer conference, Zuckerberg had demoed a new bleeding-edge kind of \u201cstandalone, inside out\u201d headset. Up until then, there were two ways to do VR: The first was with a cheap headset, maybe using your phone as a screen, that could do primitive head-movement tracking but had no way to see the environment around you. The second was with external sensors on the walls and a headset that attached to a high-powered PC with a cord. \u201cStandalone\u201d meant the new headset would have the computer inside, with no need for a cable. \u201cInside out\u201d meant the headset could see the room around you, so you didn\u2019t need external sensors. In 2016, this was just a prototype. Three years later, Facebook launched Oculus Quest.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>   In 2020, standing around during Covid with my dick in my hand like everyone else, I got myself a Quest 2. It was amazing. I loved it. It was my daily post-writing reward activity. I made <a href=\"https://www.tiltbrush.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">3D art</a>. I <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/experiences/2134272053250863/?ranking_trace=0_2134272053250863_SKYLINEWEBQUESTSEARCH_1vKvJ1edv2vQxMeJK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">swam with whales</a>. I went on <a href=\"https://vacationsimulatorgame.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cartoon vacations</a>. I exercised by <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/experiences/2448060205267927/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">slashing music</a>. I beat <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/experiences/2718107161580827/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Trover</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>   Then, for some reason, I stopped. I can\u2019t really explain why. I really loved being in the Quest 2. I recently dusted it off to give friends a demo and they were floored, reminding me how great it is. It just didn\u2019t <em>hook </em>me. Maybe it was the solo aspect. I don\u2019t have friends who do VR so there\u2019s no one else to play with. Maybe it\u2019s the friction. It\u2019s minor, but charging the headset, putting it on, and creating a boundary<a href=\"#footnote-1-10470\" id=\"note-1-10470\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a> is still a lot more friction than picking up my phone. Maybe my delight relied more on novelty than I realized. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>   It\u2019s not just me. VR blows everyone away when they try it, but it seems to have a hard time hooking people for the long run. After a major wave of hype in the mid-2010s, VR receded into the land of subcultures. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  And the question is: Is there some fatal flaw to the concept of VR that will always prevent it from achieving mass adoption? Or are we some tipping point away from VR exploding into the stratosphere like the computer and smartphone?\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Enter Apple</strong>\n</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>   Everyone remembers where they were when they learned that JFK was shot, a man had landed on the moon, or airplanes had flown into the Twin Towers. I remember where I was when I saw Steve Jobs <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKMoT-6XSg&amp;ab_channel=ProtectstarInc.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">unveil the first iPhone</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  I didn\u2019t always like Apple. My family\u2019s first computer was an Apple 2GS. But then, like many early Apple computer users, I became a PC person. I used an IBM ThinkPad in college and thought Apple people were annoying.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Then Steve Jobs came back to Apple and started Making Apple Great Again. My post-college music composing path forced me to get a 2004 PowerBook G4. After getting used to the interface (<em>why</em> <em>the fuck is there no start button?</em>), I realized that Macs were amazing, and I\u2019ve been an annoying Apple person ever since. But it wasn\u2019t until 2007 that I became a <em>fanboy.</em>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>   In the presentation, when Jobs did the world\u2019s first \u201cswipe to unlock,\u201d the audience made an <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VQKMoT-6XSg?si=_ruGaoE1NWaLBrjC&amp;t=933\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">audible gasp</a>. A minute later, he brought up a list of artists in the phone\u2019s \u201ciPod\u201d app and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VQKMoT-6XSg?si=WXikR3ntj4j3EXd-&amp;t=972\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">asked</a>, \u201cWell, how do I scroll through my list of artists? I just take my finger and scroll.\u201d Another audible gasp. It\u2019s weird that something so normal today was jaw-dropping 17 years ago. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>   The feeling I had watching that presentation had happened before. I felt it when I was five years old and tried Nintendo for the first time at a friend\u2019s house (<em>I can make something on the TV move by clicking this button??</em>). I felt it in the early \u201890s when my friend showed me how to send an email (<em>You can type something on your computer, hit a button, and it shows up on mine??)</em>.<em> </em>I felt it the first time I test-drove a Tesla (<em>Why is this car accelerating so futuristically?</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  I\u2019ve learned to see a lot of meaning in these holy shit moments. In most cases, they\u2019ve been followed by an entirely new industry sweeping the world\u2014like the smartphone, video game, internet, and electric car revolutions.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>   In June 2023, Apple <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYkq9Rgoj8E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">announced</a> the VR\u2014sorry, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/computing/software/apple-tells-developers-not-to-use-virtual-reality-when-talking-about-vision-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>spatial computing</em></a><em>\u2014</em>headset that had been long rumored: the Vision Pro.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  I watched the presentation, but it wasn\u2019t quite like my experience in 2007. First, I had gotten excited about VR multiple times in the past and ended up disappointed. Second, unlike demoing an iPhone, watching a VR demo on a 2D screen just doesn\u2019t show you what it\u2019s actually like. Oh, also, it was <em>$3,500. </em>I happily shelled out $600 for the first iPhone. But $3,500? For a V1 product that will get way better (and cheaper) in the next few years? When I already have a Meta Quest? Nah. I might be a fanboy but I\u2019m not a chump. It was the obvious grown-up decision to wait it out. Then I ordered one in the first minute after preorders started.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  This Monday morning, I went to the Apple Store to put the Vision Pro on my chump face for the first time. The staff member guided me through a demo. And there it was: the holy shit moment.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  But it was a holy shit moment with an asterisk. I had experienced full holy shit moments both in 1990 and in 2016 with VR, and these were the notable exceptions to the \u201choly shit moments are a surefire omen of an industry about to blow up\u201d rule. Was this time different or would history repeat itself?\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  What I did know was that it was finally time to write a VR post. I wanted to post this week while everyone was hyped up about the Vision Pro. But I didn\u2019t want to write about it before I had used it a <em>lot</em>, so I could experience not only the honeymoon phase but also what it was like to get thoroughly sick of it.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  The plan was clear. I went home, told my wife that I would be deeply ignoring her and our baby for the week, and spent twelve hours a day in the headset for four straight days. I\u2019m writing this on Thursday afternoon, having already logged over forty hours. Here are my thoughts.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Vision Pro, V1</strong>\n</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  There are three elements of any VR system: hardware, operating system, and applications. Let\u2019s talk about each.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hardware</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-medium\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/headset.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/headset-600x337.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10480\" srcset=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/headset-600x337.jpg 600w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/headset-750x422.jpg 750w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/headset-768x432.jpg 768w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/headset.jpg 980w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>   Apple Vision Pro (AVP)<a href=\"#footnote2-1-10470\" id=\"note2-1-10470\" rel=\"footnote2\">1</a> is heavy\u2014a decent amount heavier (650 grams) than Meta\u2019s Quest 3 (515 grams). It comes with a fancy band that goes on easily and you tighten with a little knob. It\u2019s awesome. For 12 minutes. Then it started killing my face. With 3,500 regrets, I switched to the other band it comes with, which includes a loop that goes over the top of your head, and thank god for that because it was <em>way </em>better\u2014so good that I am shocked to say that even at the end of a full day wearing it, I didn\u2019t feel a euphoric \u201cahhh\u201d relief taking it off. At least right now, it seems only a little more uncomfortable than wearing over-ear headphones for long periods of time. This might not apply to everyone, but I have not felt nauseous once while wearing it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  That doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s nothing that sucks about wearing it. The \u201cfield of view\u201d isn\u2019t great, meaning there are thick black walls where your peripheral vision is supposed to be, which is a bummer. I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s great for your eyes. And there\u2019s no way around the fact that you feel like an asshole when other people are in the room. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  There\u2019s an external battery pack that connects to the headset with a cord and typically lives in my pocket. The battery lasts about three hours, but you can plug in the battery to make it last forever, like a computer if the battery only lasted for three hours. (You\u2019re often using it in conjunction with your computer, which makes it a non-issue because you can plug the battery into the computer.)\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>   When you put the headset on, it does the AVP version of Face ID: scanning your irises. This is seamless and very futuristic. Then, you see exactly what you saw before putting the headset on. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Gy035z_KA&amp;ab_channel=MarquesBrownlee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lots</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7hJlyVDEc8&amp;ab_channel=CleoAbram\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">of</a> <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/the_vision_pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reviewers</a> have marveled over AVP\u2019s \u201cpass-through\u201d capabilities, and the second I put it on, I understood why. While it\u2019s not perfect, it\u2019s <em>almost </em>like you\u2019re wearing a transparent snorkeling mask. The headset is in fact opaque\u2014cameras on the outside transmit the world onto screens on the inside. But the screens are so good and the latency so low that it really seems transparent. Then there\u2019s the much less successful attempt to make it look transparent from the outside as well, using cameras on the inside to broadcast your eyes onto the front of the headset. The goal is that if you\u2019re talking to someone while wearing the headset, it feels to <em>both </em>people like you\u2019re wearing a transparent snorkeling mask. But at least in V1, the eyes don\u2019t show up nearly as well as <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/applead-eyes.png\">advertised</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>   The internal screens save energy by doing something clever called \u201cfoveated rendering\u201d\u2014i.e. only putting the exact place you\u2019re looking in perfect focus while making the rest of the view lower-res. This is what your actual eyes do, which is why your peripheral vision is blurry. If you watch this <a href=\"https://x.com/waitbutwhy/status/1755000159698612346?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">viewcast</a> I made, you\u2019ll see that most of it is blurry (the sharp part was where I happened to be looking while taking it)\u2014but as the person in the headset, I only ever saw perfect sharpness. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>   The way Vision Pro does audio is also cool. There have always been two sound options for me while on my phone or computer: play from the speaker and everyone can hear it or put on headphones and no one can hear it. AVP speakers are somewhere in between. The speakers (which sound great) are small and right above your ears, and while people right next to you can hear what you\u2019re hearing, people in the next room cannot. So in a coffee shop or on an airplane, you still need headphones, but I do a lot of my work in an office in our house with the door open, and it\u2019s been nice to work both without headphones <em>and </em>without bothering anyone in the other room. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Operating System</strong>\n</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  This was the biggest holy shit of my holy shit moment. Apple is the king of simple intuitive interfaces. Part of what drew those gasps in 2007 was how <em>natural </em>the iPhone\u2019s interface was. You scrolled down by pushing the page up, just like you would in real life. You zoomed by pinching with two fingers. It seemed like magic. AVP\u2019s interface is gaspworthy for the same reason. The main gesture is what I\u2019ve been calling the \u201ceye pinch.\u201d\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>   When you press the button at the top of the headset, your apps come up, floating in the room in front of you, looking as real as any other object in the room. They&#8217;re fixed in space. You can walk right up to them, and the detail is amazing.<a href=\"#footnote2-2-10470\" id=\"note2-2-10470\" rel=\"footnote2\">2</a>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/appsinroom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"835\" height=\"511\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/appsinroom.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10482\" style=\"width:600px\" srcset=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/appsinroom.png 835w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/appsinroom-600x367.png 600w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/appsinroom-750x459.png 750w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/appsinroom-768x470.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 835px) 100vw, 835px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>   Vision Pro\u2019s eye tracking is outrageously good. It knows <em>precisely </em>where you\u2019re looking. So all you do to select an app is look at it and tap your thumb and index finger together. Your hand doesn\u2019t need to move up to do this, just somewhere the headset can see it. Watching the ads, it seemed like this might be annoying to do, but it\u2019s every bit as easy and intuitive as opening an app on a smartphone.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>   No matter what you\u2019re doing, the eye pinch is the equivalent of touching a finger to a smartphone screen. To scroll, look anywhere in the window, pinch, and move your hand up. To move a window, look at the little bar below the window, pinch, and move it where you want to. To resize the window, look at the window\u2019s corner, pinch, and resize. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>   As John Gruber put it in his <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/the_vision_pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">review</a>: </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The fundamental interaction model in VisionOS feels like it will be copied by all future VR/AR headsets, in the same way that all desktop computers work like the Mac, and all phones and tablets now work like the iPhone. And when that happens, some will argue that of course they all work that way, because how else could they work? But personal computers didn\u2019t have point-and-click GUIs before the Mac, and phones didn\u2019t have \u201cit\u2019s all just a big touchscreen\u201d interfaces before the iPhone. No other headset today has a \u201cjust look at a target, and tap your finger and thumb\u201d interface today. I suspect in a few years they all will.</em>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>   Then there\u2019s the fact that everything you see in front of you is available desktop to work with. On my computer, I\u2019m used to my applications being stacked, and I toggle between them. Or maybe I put a few vertical windows side by side. In AVP, I can put one eight-foot window in front of me, two more on either side of it, and a couple more <em>above </em>them in the sky. Then, if I get up to go to the other room, the windows all stay exactly where they are, waiting for me to come back. If I want to switch work spots, I just hold the headset button and the whole configuration jumps to the new location. This is all way cooler than I\u2019m making it sound, so I made a video to show you how it works:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"My Work Day in a Vision Pro\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F3CZD-K04KI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>   One thing you\u2019ll notice in the video is that I routinely spin the digital crown on the headset to slide between being entirely in reality, partially in reality, and entirely in a virtual landscape. This is ridiculously fun to do. And it\u2019s a general reminder that AR and VR<a href=\"#footnote-2-10470\" id=\"note-2-10470\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a> being separate categories is a thing of the past. In the Vision Pro, the Quest 3, and any future headset, you can be 100% in the real world (when there\u2019s nothing on the screen and it seems like you\u2019re wearing a snorkeling mask), you can be mostly in the real world except there\u2019s a virtual <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-dJu9VyIw64?si=CXyrl8KvUcYQ5uYZ&amp;t=449\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">game board</a> on your kitchen table or a little virtual butterfly fluttering around. You can be halfway between reality and virtual when, say, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-dJu9VyIw64?si=N85diDS1-4EDe5-1&amp;t=476\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">portals open up</a> in the walls around you during a game. Or you can go full virtual. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Apps</strong>\n</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  There are many categories of spatial computing apps\u2014productivity, entertainment, social, gaming, creative, fitness\u2014and for most of them today, you\u2019ll need a Meta Quest or some other non-Apple headset. There are a small handful of astounding<em> </em>apps for AVP, but they\u2019re more a sampling of what\u2019s possible than an actual app store.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  The most \u201cyou can absolutely not do this anywhere but a VR headset\u201d thing I did was their little taster menu of immersive entertainment. Entertainment on a headset runs on a spectrum of immersion. The least immersive is watching a normal movie on a massive screen in a virtual space like the moon or a giant theater. Those movies you missed that everyone says are best seen on the big screen\u2014you can see those on a big screen now. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Next are movies that are framed in a normal rectangle, but they\u2019re 3D looking\u2014like when we used to wear those stupid paper glasses but much, much better. Sometimes, these surprise you when something comes <em>out </em>of the screen to fly through the air or stand on the floor between you and the screen. The AVR comes with one of these\u2014\u201cEncounter Dinosaurs\u201d\u2014and it\u2019s delightful. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Finally, there\u2019s full immersion, where the scene entirely surrounds you and you actually feel like you\u2019re there. These are better described as \u201cexperiences\u201d than \u201centertainment.\u201d I saw rhinos up close in person last year. Then, this week, I did one of the Vision Pro experiences that\u2019s an up-close hang with rhinos. These two experiences were <em>very </em>similar. Another experience lets you sit in on an Alicia Keys rehearsal where she sings some songs standing two feet away from you. You can watch her for a while, then look over at what the drummer or keyboardist is doing for a while\u2014just like you would if you were actually there.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Photos and videos are also cool. When you take a panoramic photo, you sweep your phone around in a C-shaped arc\u2014but on a flat phone screen, the result is a flat photo. In AVP, panos are C-shaped, like the photo you actually took. The C wraps around you, which I quickly learned brings the memory back way better than the flat version. You can also turn the headset into a camera and record photos and videos, both of which are immersive. When you later view them in the headset, they\u2019re 3D, putting you right back into the actual scene.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Then there\u2019s the infamous Vision Pro avatars. You get one of these by flipping the headset around and letting it take pictures of you from different angles. Then when you FaceTime someone, your avatar mimics whatever facial expressions you\u2019re making. Here\u2019s mine:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"636\" height=\"586\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/timavatar.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10504\" style=\"width:400px\" srcset=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/timavatar.png 636w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/timavatar-600x553.png 600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  The first person I tested it out on was my wife, who immediately gasped in horror, saying I had \u201clittle uncanny valley snake eyes rolling around in my skull,\u201d whatever the fuck that means.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>   The uncanny valley she\u2019s upset about is this:<a href=\"#footnote2-3-10470\" id=\"note2-3-10470\" rel=\"footnote2\">3</a>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-medium is-resized\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/uncannyvalley.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"324\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/uncannyvalley-600x324.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10483\" style=\"width:550px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/uncannyvalley-600x324.png 600w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/uncannyvalley-750x405.png 750w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/uncannyvalley-768x415.png 768w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/uncannyvalley-1536x830.png 1536w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/uncannyvalley-239x130.png 239w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/uncannyvalley.png 2001w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  The idea is that we like faces that are somewhat humanlike, and we like faces that are totally humanlike, but we <em>hate </em>faces that are almost-but-not-totally humanlike. Faces that fall just short of being human give us the collective willies. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Avatars used to suck. Then they got better. Now they\u2019ve gotten so good they\u2019ve plunged into the uncanny valley. This was always gonna happen at some point on the road to perfect avatars and that time is now.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>   To test it out for myself, I FaceTimed my friend <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@julesterpak\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Jules Terpak</a>, who also has a Vision Pro. First I put her across from me at this table while we sat around with each other\u2019s uncanny valley faces for a few minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-Office.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1082\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-Office.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10484\" style=\"width:550px\" srcset=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-Office.jpg 2000w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-Office-600x325.jpg 600w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-Office-750x406.jpg 750w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-Office-768x415.jpg 768w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-Office-1536x831.jpg 1536w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-Office-239x130.jpg 239w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  One very cool thing is that when I moved her window to a different seat at the table, her voice shifted locations to that spot. We concluded that this activity was not actually an upgrade over FaceTime, but that if there were more than two people, it could feel like everyone was sitting around a table together, which would be better than talking to a group FaceTime or Zoom.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Then we shifted locations to Mount Hood.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-Mt-Hood.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1082\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-Mt-Hood.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10485\" style=\"width:600px\" srcset=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-Mt-Hood.jpg 2000w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-Mt-Hood-600x325.jpg 600w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-Mt-Hood-750x406.jpg 750w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-Mt-Hood-768x415.jpg 768w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-Mt-Hood-1536x831.jpg 1536w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-Mt-Hood-239x130.jpg 239w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  This felt more like we were actually hanging out somewhere, which is an effect you can\u2019t get on FaceTime. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  When we started going into apps together, it felt even more like we were actually doing an activity together, in a way you normally can\u2019t do without being in person. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-apps.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2130\" height=\"1592\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-apps.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10486\" style=\"width:550px\" srcset=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-apps.png 2130w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-apps-600x448.png 600w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-apps-750x561.png 750w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-apps-768x574.png 768w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-apps-1536x1148.png 1536w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-apps-2048x1531.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2130px) 100vw, 2130px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>   It\u2019s very crude right now, but it\u2019s a primitive version of something we\u2019ll probably all be doing constantly in the 2030s. It\u2019s the next step in a centuries-long human mission to conquer long-distance. First there were letters, then phone calls, then mobile phones<a href=\"#footnote-3-10470\" id=\"note-3-10470\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a> and video calls. The next step is VR hangouts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>   By far the thing I spent the most time doing in the Vision Pro was exactly what I normally do, but the AVP version. When you\u2019re sitting down in front of your computer while wearing the headset, you can open your computer screen as a giant virtual window (which you still control with your normal keyboard and trackpad). Whatever screen you\u2019re used to working on is now much, much bigger. It\u2019s also much more mobile. I don\u2019t usually work on the couch because I prefer my big monitor over my laptop screen. This week, I spent a lot of time working on my couch on a 100-inch monitor. I don\u2019t normally work lying flat in bed because the laptop screen isn\u2019t directly above me. This week I did, putting the screen up on the ceiling. I did some work outside on the porch and some more under a tree. Sometimes I saw the room around me, only with a big screen floating in it. Other times, I went fully immersive, writing on a mountain top, a sand dune, or the moon. And as I mentioned at the beginning of the post, I\u2019m <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/timincafe-scaled.jpeg\">currently</a> using the AVP in a coffee shop, which is officially <a href=\"https://x.com/waitbutwhy/status/1755672453999710482?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">embarrassing</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>   For some odd reason, you can\u2019t open multiple desktops (yet), but you <em>can </em>open some of the things on your desktop as their own apps in separate windows. There\u2019s an AVP iMessage app, so I closed iMessage on my desktop and opened it in an adjacent window. I often remotely cowork with Alicia (WBW\u2019s Manager of Lots of Things), putting her in a little window in the corner of my screen. Now, she\u2019s in her own window. If I\u2019m willing to bite the bullet and switch from Chrome to Safari, I can pull my research and web browsing off the desktop too. The end result is that a single small, immobile computer screen has been replaced with a giant mosaic of screens, for the small price of having a snorkeling mask on my face all day. It kind of feels like you stepped into your computer screen, into the beautiful wallpaper landscape, amongst the windows. Very surreal. I wrote this entire post in the headset and have found myself enjoying writing more\u2014and being more focused\u2014than normal. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>My overall feelings</strong>\n</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  The best way I can describe how I feel about the Vision Pro is a strange combination of utterly thunderstruck and mildly underwhelmed. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  The magical interface, the giant screens, the immersive experiences\u2014they\u2019re just unfathomably cool and awe-inspiring. It feels like a sneak peek at the 2030s.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  But after a couple of days, I found myself thinking, \u201cIs that\u2026it?\u201d I had done the small handful of immersive experiences, played some of the small selection of games, looked at a bunch of my panoramic photos, and tried avatar FaceTime\u2014and at the moment, there\u2019s just not that much else to do in the Vision Pro.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  The first iPhone left me feeling the same combination of blown away and bored. The phone and I had a torrid honeymoon, but after the novelty of the interface wore off, all it had to offer was the same 16 practical apps.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/iphone-os1.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"259\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/iphone-os1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10493\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  There was no app store yet, it dropped calls constantly, and the cellular internet (which you couldn\u2019t use while on a call) was painfully slow. The iPhone wasn\u2019t a world-changing device yet. It was the seed from which a world-changing device would grow.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  If you zoom out on a story of technology, you usually see a big exponential curve.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1187\" height=\"1124\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10487\" style=\"width:500px\" srcset=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-1.png 1187w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-1-600x568.png 600w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-1-750x710.png 750w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-1-768x727.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1187px) 100vw, 1187px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  But if you look at the curve up close, you see that it\u2019s wavy, made of S-curves.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1249\" height=\"1124\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10488\" style=\"width:500px\" srcset=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-2.png 1249w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-2-600x540.png 600w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-2-750x675.png 750w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-2-768x691.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1249px) 100vw, 1249px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  The first iPhone was such a big deal because it launched a new S. Investors had a new place to pour their money. Developers had a new place to pour their efforts. Creators had a new place to pour their talents. As millions of human hours worked on the collective human project, the next five years were a whirlwind of innovation and excitement. Apple\u2019s keynotes became a must-watch for anyone interested in tech, as each jump between the iPhone 1 &gt; 3G &gt; 3GS &gt; 4 &gt; 4S &gt; 5 was a major leap in hardware and software. It was the steep part of the S.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-3.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1121\" height=\"986\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10489\" style=\"width:500px\" srcset=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-3.png 1121w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-3-600x528.png 600w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-3-750x660.png 750w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-3-768x676.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1121px) 100vw, 1121px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Then, the keynotes got boring. The changes were incremental. Apple stopped innovating and started refining. This coincided with Tim Cook taking over, but it isn\u2019t his fault. The steep part of the S-curve doesn\u2019t go on forever, and companies often reap the biggest rewards in the boring, top part of the S once the industry matures.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Maybe the reason VR has been slow to take off isn\u2019t because there\u2019s something fundamentally wrong with VR. Maybe it\u2019s because, for the last decade, we\u2019ve been working our way through the very early part of the VR S-curve\u2014the slow part where foundational technology is researched and built. My Vision Pro is highly imperfect\u2014overpriced, heavy, slightly glitchy, very limited, creepy-avatared\u2014because that\u2019s exactly what products are like at the bottom of the S. Consumer products aren\u2019t ready for mass adoption during this stage. But it\u2019s the breakthroughs made during these years that set the stage for the explosive exponential phase of the curve.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>   The lesson from past VR hype cycles is to temper expectations. The VR S-Curve explosion may be many years away or never come at all. But the lesson from past Apple launches is don\u2019t bet against Apple, and Apple\u2019s bet is that the Vision Pro could be a seed like the first iPhone\u2014a platform for innovation that kicks a new S-curve into high gear.<a href=\"#footnote-4-10470\" id=\"note-4-10470\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a>  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Vision Pro, V2 &#8211; V10</strong>\n</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  For someone to regularly use a piece of technology, the benefits have to outweigh the costs.

Would you get a cell phone if the only way they came was attached a briefcase? Maybe, but it\u2019s a close call. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  For VR to achieve mass adoption, the good needs to be better and the bad needs to be less bad. It\u2019s easy to imagine a pathway to both.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  The operating system will get better each year. The two-finger pinch is currently the only gesture. More will be added. Eventually, there may be dozens of ways to make gestures with our fingers, each one a different command, like today\u2019s keyboard shortcuts. When you spend ten minutes setting up an elaborate configuration of windows, you\u2019ll be able to save (and share) it.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Avatars will go from uncanny valley to indistinguishable from your normal face. When you go into immersive environments, you can currently see only your hands. In the future, you\u2019ll be able to identify other objects to remain visible (like a coffee mug). The environments around you will expand from the six current options to hundreds, including delightful fantasy worlds, and they\u2019ll be interactive, allowing you to change things like the weather.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>   The hardware will get continually smaller and more comfortable. The resolution and frame rate will become as advanced as the latency. The battery will get way better. So will the look from the outside: to people in the room, the headset will come to look totally transparent. (My personal fantasy: The computer itself becomes detachable, allowing the headset to be a light, sleek, cool-looking visor. The computer and battery snap together into something the size of a smartphone. You\u2019ll be able to snap it to the back of your visor if you don\u2019t want the cord, but most people will prefer the weight to be somewhere other than their heads. The computer/battery rectangle will also have a screen and function as a smartphone for times when you want to do something with the visor off. The visor will fold neatly onto the rectangle to make the whole thing a single compact object.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Finally, the amount of content, applications, and experiences will multiply by 1,000-fold, just like the apps in the app store did from 2008 to today. There will be a wide array of immersive games and entertainment. People will watch sports from one of many vantage points on the field, sideline, stands, or overhead\u2014next to their friends, who will be able to look at each other and talk as well as if they were actually together in person. Pop stars will play in front of 50,000 people in person and 5 million people virtually. Fitness will become fun, interactive, and social. The best teachers and coaches will reach millions of people. Amazing AI teachers could reach billions. Distance will melt away, allowing people to spend high-quality time with their loved ones, no matter where they are. People who couldn\u2019t dream of traveling the world today will get to enjoy vivid experiences anywhere on the globe. Of course, my silly 2024 imagination can\u2019t scratch the surface any more than people in the briefcase phone days could have predicted Uber, TikTok, or Tinder.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Over time, the price will come down, with some companies making headsets dirt cheap the way they have for smartphones today. As the value proposition gets better and better, more people will have them, enhancing the social component and eradicating any stigma. Mass adoption seems like a very real future possibility.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>   I know what many of you are thinking: A world where everyone is in VR headsets (or visors, or glasses, or contact lenses) sounds<em> </em>dystopian and <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/goldblum.jpg\">awful</a>.

Just two weeks after the book launch, my first baby would be born. I\u2019d promote the book, catch my breath, and then begin the new adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank god for those critical two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The night before book launch was (obviously) a frantic all-nighter, and I eventually went to bed after 40 hours awake, exhausted and satisfied. We had done it. The book was live. It was over. I\u2019d actually wake up tomorrow without this project hanging over my head. The sky would be blue. I\u2019d finally be free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I woke up close to noon and felt at peace for three seconds before opening my phone and seeing three texts from my wife:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/01_water-broke.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/01_water-broke.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10204\" width=\"481\" height=\"178\" srcset=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/01_water-broke.png 1167w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/01_water-broke-600x222.png 600w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/01_water-broke-750x277.png 750w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/01_water-broke-768x284.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hm?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I knew what water breaking was. But I didn\u2019t know what it meant. Is the baby coming out now? Or was this one of the false alarms I had heard about and the baby is still a couple weeks away? Is there a chance she just peed her pants and is misdiagnosing the situation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After some rapid-fire googling, one thing was clear: We had to go to the hospital. Now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The drive was weird. I had pictured myself heroically driving a screaming labor-having wife to the hospital, but here I was driving normally to the hospital with a very normal wife next to me. Apart from her new leaking situation, nothing was different than it was yesterday. There was no way we were actually having a baby today. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon arrival, the PA assessed things and yes her water had broken, and yes in order to avoid infection that meant the baby had to come out now. Two hours and 12 canceled book-promoting podcasts later, we\u2019re in our delivery room, where my still-not-in-labor wife would supposedly be producing a baby sometime later today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, there was a major expectations-reality gap. I had pictured the day of my first child\u2019s birth being impossibly frenetic and emotional and intense. But there we were, eating animal crackers and gummies from the treats-you-can-eat-while-in-labor bag, hanging out and chatting like any other day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My wife was hooked up to a bunch of tubes and machines and the plan was to see if contractions would start on their own as a reaction to her water breaking, but a few hours passed and nothing happened. Eventually, the nurse came in and poured a magical little chemical called Pitocin into her IV bag. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And things started happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contractions began, which my wife described as \u201ca really bad period cramp,\u201d which helped me understand what they felt like 0%. Over the next couple hours they got worse and worse. I was quickly assigned the role of \u201cdon\u2019t say or do anything\u201d while contractions were happening, so I\u2019d just kind of sit there awkwardly and watch with this face on:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-thumbnail is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/02_emoji-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10205\" width=\"54\" height=\"54\" srcset=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/02_emoji-150x150.png 150w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/02_emoji-600x587.png 600w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/02_emoji-750x734.png 750w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/02_emoji-768x752.png 768w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/02_emoji.png 1258w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 54px) 100vw, 54px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Her epidural plan was something like \u201cdefinitely get one but tough it out a little first,\u201d and after a particularly awful contraction, she called it a day and the epidural team came in to do their thing. 45 minutes later, we\u2019re back in the \u201cI know this is the day of the birth of our first child but it sure doesn\u2019t feel like it\u201d zone, chatting and hanging out normally. After a few more hours, a nurse came in and checked on the dilation situation and was like \u201calright, let\u2019s do this!\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once again, nothing like I pictured. I thought there would be a big team of doctors and nurses doing a whole big hectic thing and I\u2019d be standing somewhere on the side. Instead, it was me and this nurse, each holding a leg.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/03_birth-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/03_birth-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10206\" width=\"550\" height=\"447\" srcset=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/03_birth-1.png 1397w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/03_birth-1-600x488.png 600w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/03_birth-1-750x610.png 750w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/03_birth-1-768x625.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The game went like this: When a contraction starts, we each grab a leg and she pushes really hard for 10 seconds three times in a row. Then everyone chills and hangs out for a few minutes until the next contraction. And repeat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a few rounds of this, it was clear this was not gonna work. Nothing was coming out. But we kept trying anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I saw it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The edge of an upsetting slimy pancake.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/04_birth-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/04_birth-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10207\" width=\"550\" height=\"492\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When I asked what the upsetting slimy pancake edge was, the nurse told me it was my daughter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh huh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This then went on for a while. We\u2019d do a round of pushing, the upsetting pancake thing would come out a centimeter and then go back in, and each round it would come out a few more millimeters. It was increasingly feeling like we really weren\u2019t getting anywhere with this strategy when the nurse suddenly says \u201cokay let\u2019s deliver a baby!\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She makes a call and a few minutes later a group of people come in, including the first doctor we had seen that day. The next contraction came along, I leg-held, my wife pushed, and then in the most surreal moment of my life, I was staring at a tiny screaming alien.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/05_birth-3.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/05_birth-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10208\" width=\"404\" height=\"374\" srcset=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/05_birth-3.png 807w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/05_birth-3-600x556.png 600w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/05_birth-3-750x695.png 750w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/05_birth-3-768x712.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">___________</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was 3 months ago.

Babies are cute and roly-poly and can see and are conscious and are normal and a newborn is not any of these things. It is a bizarre human larva that <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/CqWS89MAE-5/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">acts super weird</a> and would still be in the womb if it could be. The problem is, when humans went bipedal, our pelvises got smaller, and as humans got smarter, our heads got bigger. So evolution had to get creative. Its solution: all human babies would be premies, born when they were still small enough to pass through a human pelvis. The last couple months as a fetus would happen outside the womb, and everyone would just have to deal with that. This became incredibly obvious during the first month with my daughter. She was a raw human id not remotely ready for primetime. Thankfully, since then, a baby has grown around the id and now she has the figure of a miniature 390-pound 84-year-old woman.<a href=\"#footnote-1-10203\" id=\"note-1-10203\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2) It is insane that there\u2019s not some required training for new-parents-to-be</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If I want to drive a car, I have to take driver\u2019s ed first. If I want to provide medical advice, I have to go to med school first.

I could squish her face, but then she\u2019d cry and I\u2019d be abusing a baby. In the early weeks, there\u2019s just not really a satisfying outlet for your baby fondness and it\u2019s annoying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One other one-sided thing is you\u2019re apparently supposed to talk to your newborn even though they\u2019re an unconscious fetus because it supposedly helps develop their brain. So now my baby has heard multiple versions of my next book outline, the full story of the rise and fall of the Assyrian Empire after I listened to a podcast about it, and a list of every World Series champion going back to 1990. Never once has the baby shown any sign of being affected by any of this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>*That said, I\u2019ve always thought of parental love as the most intense form of love\u2014the kind where if you had a Sophie\u2019s choice where your baby and spouse were both hanging off a cliff and you could only save one, you\u2019d save the baby without a second thought. And\u2026yeah I\u2019m not there yet. I love this little creature a freakish amount, but as of now, I\u2019m definitely saving my wife in that situation. Sorry kiddo.

They\u2019re terrible at thinking, at knowing anything, at moving all parts of their body. The cool thing is that spending time with a super unimpressive baby has made me super impressed by myself. Like I\u2019ll watch the baby sitting in a <a href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0057/9797/0008/products/Babybjorn-Toy-Bar-Image-2_1400x.jpg?v=1556318117\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">baby bouncer</a> trying to reach for a little wooden flower one foot in front of her and she just flings her arm in the general direction and misses by a lot. Then I\u2019ll reach for a glass of water and all of my joints work together to send my hand on a perfectly straight path through three-dimensional space, gracefully clasp my fingers around it using the perfect amount of pressure, raise it to my mouth, tilt it in perfect sync with the movement of my lips, and then return the glass to the table and gently place it down like an absolute genius.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9) You don\u2019t go from a non-parent to a parent overnight</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some things are just too big for our little human brains to fully absorb. The bigness of the universe. The permanence of death. The magnitude of the <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/09/marriage-decision.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">marriage decision</a>, which I <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/02/pick-life-partner.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">once described</a> like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When you choose a life partner, you\u2019re choosing a lot of things, including your parenting partner and someone who will deeply influence your children, your eating companion for about 20,000 meals, your travel companion for about 100 vacations, your primary leisure time and retirement friend, your career therapist, and someone whose day you\u2019ll hear about 18,000 times. Intense shit.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months into fatherhood, this feels like another item in that category. When your baby is born, you will (hopefully) never live another day as a non-parent. For people who make the decision to do this, it is the BC-AD line of their life. It doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t still be you, but you are trading in one kind of life for another, with all of the pros and cons that come along with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been able to quite wrap my head around the bigness of the situation. A curious childless friend asked me the other day if I feel like a dad, and I surprised myself by answering \u201cnot really.\u201d I mostly feel like old me that has this new delightful little thing living in my house. When I see friends with sentient kids actually parenting them, saying things like \u201cthat\u2019s not nice, stop it,\u201d whatever that must be like is as much of a mystery to me as it was three months ago. For me at least, it seems like a parent is something you slowly turn into as your first baby slowly turns into a person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Btw I\u2019m now even more convinced than I was before that this is the most personal of personal decisions and no one should ever try to pressure anyone else to have kids\u2014it\u2019s way too big a thing to be anyone else\u2019s business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10) Having a baby really makes you think about the future</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every parent in history has brought their baby into a world with an uncertain future. But our future is the uncertainest. My baby might live a life a lot like mine, just a little more futuristic. Or she might live to 500. She might live most of her life with a <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">brain-machine interface</a> implanted in her head, thinking with her own superintelligent AI. She might suffer through civilizational collapse. She might live in a world that would seem like utopia to us today. She might live on Mars. She might meet aliens. She might die in the apocalypse. There\u2019s just no way to know.

Obama was president, the Cavs were on their way to beating the Warriors in the NBA finals, Game of Thrones was still good, and I was 34 years old with my whole life ahead of me.</p>\n<p>Wait But Why had been around for three years, a stretch during which I wrote about 100 blog posts on dozens of topics. On the afternoon of June 18, 2016, I was sitting on the couch engaging in a familiar ritual: looking through my list of future post ideas, trying to pick my next topic. And then I had a thought.</p>\n<p>So many of the post ideas I was scanning through were about the future. Virtual reality. Artificial intelligence. Genetic engineering. Life extension. Multiplanetary expansion. But lately, it felt like there was a cloud hanging over all these topics.</p>\n<p>My urge to write about the future comes from an excited optimism that\u2019s fundamental to my personality. I believe at a deep level that the future is going to be an amazing, exhilarating ride, and nothing is more fun than learning about cutting edge developments that can offer clues into what magic might lie down the road.</p>\n<p>But on June 18, 2016, I didn\u2019t feel excitedly optimistic. There was a different feel to the world than there had been in my previous blogging years. Something seemed <em>off</em> about the society around me, like there had been a subtle, foreboding shift in the balance between reason and madness. It felt like we were losing our grip on something important.</p>\n<p>The fun thing about being a blogger is you can write about whatever the fuck you want. And a good compass for me had always been that if something was incessantly on my mind, it was probably a good post topic. So I decided to write what I call a \u201cmini post.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wait But Why articles are long, and they go deep. I bathe in the topic for a little while, dread writing it for a little while, then finally pump it out, draw the drawings, give it a read, and post. A mini-post is much chiller\u2014I just open WordPress and type what\u2019s on my mind, and post it.</p>\n<p>So I opened WordPress to write a little post about that cloud I felt hovering over my other post topics. I\u2019d knock out a draft tonight, give it a read tomorrow, and publish it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-9515\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"532\" height=\"114\" srcset=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-1.png 2002w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-1-600x129.png 600w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-1-750x161.png 750w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-1-768x165.png 768w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-1-1536x329.png 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px\" /></a></p>\n<p>But nothing came out. I didn\u2019t know where to start.</p>\n<p>There were a bunch of bad trends: Tribalism was flaring up everywhere, mass shaming campaigns were roaring back into fashion, politicians were increasingly clown-like, public discourse had become a battle of one-dimensional narratives. But <em>why </em>was all of this happening now? Was the problem related to social media? To politics or current events? Was it some broader cultural or psychological phenomenon?</p>\n<p>I also noticed that I wasn\u2019t feeling the normal confidence I felt when I started a new post. Something about this topic felt <em>scary</em>. I never felt scared to write about anything before. This fear of writing about this topic seemed like it was an important <em>part </em>of the topic.</p>\n<p>Nope. Not a mini-post. I needed the full week for this one.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-9514\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"585\" height=\"110\" srcset=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-2.png 2275w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-2-600x113.png 600w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-2-750x141.png 750w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-2-768x145.png 768w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-2-1536x290.png 1536w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-2-2048x386.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" /></a></p>\n<p>But a funny thing happened that week. I didn\u2019t write anything. Instead, I started jotting down notes and ideas in a Text Edit document called \u201csociety\u201d that quickly became long and messy. I abandoned that document and opened up \u201csociety 2\u201d to give myself a fresh start. Soon there was a Society folder with seven note documents.</p>\n<p>I could have just stopped there. Too big a topic, too out of my wheelhouse, too icky, too scary. An outline for a virtual reality post was sitting right there in my Future Posts folder waiting for me.</p>\n<p>But I\u2019m really, really bad with the sunk cost fallacy. I had already put so much time and thought in, and I couldn\u2019t handle all of it being for nothing.</p>\n<p>And so began the next six years of my life.</p>\n<p>I wish I could say that I actively decided to put everything else aside and write a giant opus on the problems with my society. But it didn\u2019t happen like that. If you asked me at any point over the past six years when I was gonna be done with my society post\u2014and plenty of people did\u2014the answer was always, \u201cI\u2019m finally getting close.\u201d And I believed it every time. I fully believed, every time, that this thing was almost done. The delusion of a madman.</p>\n<p>And the problem with this particular delusion is that it\u2019s a perfect way to ruin your life. If I believed I was working on a six-year project, I\u2019d have worked the project into my normal life. I\u2019d get into a rhythm that would allow for a work-life balance. But when you think you\u2019re at <em>most</em> a couple months from finishing a big project, it makes sense to put everything else on hold for just a little bit more until the project is done. I wasn\u2019t someone who never made fun plans or who worked on every vacation or who took a lot of Vyvanse\u2014I was someone who did those things just for right now, because I\u2019m in crunch time on a big project. For six years.</p>\n<p>In May of 2017, I asked my girlfriend to marry me. We had been dating since 2011. She had seen the whole Wait But Why journey up close and had now been living with \u201cI\u2019m almost done with this big project\u201d Tim for a year. We set our wedding date for October of 2018. Thank god by then I\u2019d be out of this pit and working on all kinds of other fun projects.</p>\n<p>But instead of the project wrapping up, it just got bigger.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Three-balls.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-9518\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Three-balls.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"588\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Three-balls.png 2320w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Three-balls-600x347.png 600w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Three-balls-750x433.png 750w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Three-balls-768x444.png 768w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Three-balls-1536x887.png 1536w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Three-balls-2048x1183.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The topic had led me down dozens of totally different rabbit holes, and everything I read seemed relevant to it. I don&#8217;t like telling a partial story. Like I had in other posts, I was determined to tell the full, full story. If I noticed something in my reading or on social media or in the news that seemed like an important piece of the puzzle, it had to be incorporated. If that fucked up the current outline, then the outline would have to adapt.</p>\n<p>The problem is that the outlines became ridiculous. I couldn\u2019t keep it all in my head at once, so I made sub-outlines, and sub-sub-outlines. The Society folder now looked like this:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong> <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Documents-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-9525\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Documents-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"312\" height=\"1164\" srcset=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Documents-2.png 718w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Documents-2-161x600.png 161w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Documents-2-201x750.png 201w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Documents-2-412x1536.png 412w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Documents-2-549x2048.png 549w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px\" /></a></strong></p>\n<p>As 2017 became 2018, I decided that the wedding would be the hard deadline that I needed.

She would have a much more pleasant husband.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-3.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-9522\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"658\" height=\"477\" srcset=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-3.png 2716w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-3-600x434.png 600w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-3-750x543.png 750w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-3-768x556.png 768w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-3-1536x1112.png 1536w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-3-2048x1482.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px\" /></a></strong>I\u2019m still not sure how I turned into a crazy person. The way to proceed was obvious. I should pick a piece of this albatross, throw the rest away, and focus in on it. Do what I had done for years\u2014suck it up, get serious, knock something out, and move on with my life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">But I\u2019m a nightmare of a perfectionist and knew that the ultimate prize was to figure out how to <em>not </em>focus in but capture it <em>all </em>in a single, overarching story. It all <em>was </em>one big story, and I wanted to tell it.</p>\n<p>Wedding day came and went.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Wedding.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-9517\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Wedding.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"461\" height=\"441\" srcset=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Wedding.png 1138w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Wedding-600x574.png 600w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Wedding-750x718.png 750w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Wedding-768x735.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px\" /></a></p>\n<p>People in my life were worried about me. They tried encouraging me, shaming me, setting deadlines for me, reminding me that one post really shouldn\u2019t take multiple years. Nothing seemed to help.</p>\n<p>Finally, in mid-2019, I hatched a plan that would once and for all end this thing. Rather than post a gargantuan blog post, I\u2019d make it a <em>series</em>. This would break it into parts, which is less daunting. Plus, I had learned that the adrenaline of knowing that my readers were only days away from seeing what I was working on was a huge motivator that I had been sorely missing.</p>\n<p>I called it <em>The Story of Us</em> and in August of 2019, the first chapter went up. The whole thing would be 12 chapters, I decided, and even though the chapters got longer as they went, and the time between them expanded, it was finally happening\u2014I was <em>publishing </em>the damn thing. The end was near.</p>\n<p>Then came Chapter 11. The first 10 chapters had introduced the core framework of the series and talked broadly about the big picture of what I thought our problem was. In Chapter 11, I was going to dip into more controversial territory, looking at the past few years of news stories through the lens of the framework we had developed.</p>\n<p>It turns out I had a lot more to say about what was going on around me than I had anticipated. Soon, my draft of Chapter 11 was longer than the first ten chapters combined. I have problems.</p>\n<p>Now it was the middle of 2020. Covid was in full swing. Thousands of people were marching by my apartment in protest. It was a seismic year for American society. Everything I was writing about was happening, and rapidly evolving, literally outside my window. What I had written months earlier suddenly seemed stale. Also, Chapter 11 was over 100,000 words. Death.</p>\n<p>It started to dawn on me that I really needed to just turn this into a book. Between the mountains of feedback I had gotten from readers and friends on <em>The Story of Us </em>and the mountains of new thoughts I had about all the recent developments in the world, I knew that there was one way to really bring the project from hell home: open a blank Microsoft Word document and write a newer, better, <em>complete </em>story, and do it in a book format that people could read more easily than a web page. Somewhere, a fairy died.</p>\n<p>So I started writing the book. I\u2019d call it the name it should have always been called: <em>What\u2019s Our Problem? </em>I knew what I wanted to say. I just had to write it.</p>\n<p>I finished V1 in December of 2021 and triumphantly tweeted about it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Tweet.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-9526\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Tweet.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"578\" height=\"212\" srcset=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Tweet.png 934w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Tweet-600x220.png 600w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Tweet-750x275.png 750w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Tweet-768x281.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Done! In a sense! It was 250,000 words, which is about 150,000 words too long. And missing most of the drawings. And I had a giant \u201cADD IN\u201d document full of news stories which had happened in the year and a half since I started writing the book that would need to be incorporated.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to cut writing. Perfectionism, sunk costs, etc. Procrastination abound. I would try to cut a section down, polish it off, and move on, but kept finding myself rewriting the section entirely. I was moving at a snail\u2019s pace.</p>\n<p>Then one day in June of 2022, my wife woke me up by handing me a positive pregnancy stick. It was a surreal, joyful moment. I\u2019ve never been anyone\u2019s dad before but always wanted to be.

Let&#8217;s discuss.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of germs out there. A smaller germ, like the virus that causes covid, is 120nm across. The smallest object we can see is about 0.1mm\u2014about the width of a human hair. You&#8217;d have to line up about 800 coronaviruses to get to 0.1mm\u2014but that would be a one-dimensional line way too thin to see. To actually see something, you&#8217;d have to give it some <i>area </i>and turn the 800-virus line into an 800 x 800 square. That clump of 640,000 viruses would be just big enough to see as a tiny speck.<a href=\"#footnote-1-9079\" id=\"note-1-9079\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a> As for <i>what</i> it would look like, your guess is as good as mine Zachary.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a class=\"contentLink\" href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2020/09/universe.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">never</a></span>&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a class=\"contentLink\" href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/03/7-3-billion-people-one-building.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">good</a></span>&nbsp;<a class=\"contentLink\" href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/what-does-quadrillion-sour-patch-kids.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">at</span></a>&nbsp;<a class=\"contentLink\" href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2020/03/my-morning.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">stopping</span></a> once I start on an exploration of size, and doing this answer got me googling all kinds of things.</p>\n<p>Like how big all the bacteria in the human body would be if you clumped it all together. I had always heard the famous stat that there are 10 times as many bacteria in your body as human cells. It turns out that <a class=\"contentLink\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4991899/#:~:text=Given%20the%20dominance%20of%20bacteria,body%20is%20about%2050%E2%80%93100g.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">that&#8217;s been debunked</a>.

Zachary is 7, so let&#8217;s estimate his mass at 25 kg. That means the bacteria in his body adds up to 75 grams\u2014about the weight of a plum.

Part of why that&#8217;s so fun is the uncertainty, which makes it like a real-life adventure. Once we know what&#8217;s going to happen, the experience is less exciting for the same reason an adventure would be less exciting if you already knew how everything was gonna play out.</p>\n<p>A song works the opposite way. Not knowing where the song is going can be intellectually interesting, but what our brain really wants to do is mentally <i>dance </i>with the song, and it can&#8217;t do that if it doesn&#8217;t know the &#8220;steps.&#8221; That&#8217;s why a catchy song is only okay the first time but it can quickly become orgasmic after we hear it a few times and our brains get the hang of it. Once our brain memorizes a song, the song has a special pathway carved in our heads and it feels great to light that pathway up by hearing the song (and if we don&#8217;t give our brain the chance, it might just start lighting up the pathway itself, and the song gets &#8220;stuck in your head&#8221;).<a href=\"#footnote-4-9079\" id=\"note-4-9079\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a>\n<p>Back to films, the thing is, a film isn&#8217;t <em>just </em>a plot.

(Athens, Greece)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I can&#8217;t fall asleep, it&#8217;s either because my mind is caught in an anxious loop of some kind or my phone is keeping me up. The surefire fix to the anxious loop issue is to distract my mind with something else.</p>\n<p>But what that something else is is important. If I start texting or scrolling around social media or brainstorming / researching for work or playing an addictive iPhone game, that&#8217;ll just make me even less likely to sleep. Other activities, for whatever reason, seem to have the opposite effect and put me right to sleep. For me, what&#8217;s effective is reading in the dark on a Kindle on dark mode, listening to a podcast or audiobook,<a href=\"#footnote-6-9079\" id=\"note-6-9079\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a> doing a crossword puzzle on my phone, or as a last resort, YouTube videos, which work for the same reason it&#8217;s so easy to fall asleep in front of the TV.</p>\n<p>The problem with this is that most of these involve my phone, which also has all of those things that are great at keeping me up. Worse, when I wake up next to my phone, I inevitably start my day by getting sucked into inane phone stuff. This isn&#8217;t just a time-waster\u2014the grown-up-ness with which I start my day usually sets the tone for the whole day.

Then I leave my real phone in a different room, as far away and inconveniently located as possible. This has been pretty groundbreaking for me.

I have certain moments when I&#8217;m actually talking to myself in my head, but I find that 90% of the time my head is up in the clouds (which is most of the time) I have a lot of thoughts going on but no specific <i>words </i>in my head. I can&#8217;t tell if that&#8217;s what everyone is like or if I&#8217;m weird.

A typical blue whale is about 15 times the length of a human and around 2,500 times the mass. A human compared to microbes is many orders of magnitude larger. We\u2019re less big amongst mammals, but even there we\u2019re bigger than we are small. A human is about 35 times the length of the smallest mammal\u2014the adorable <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mailbag-2_bumblebee-bat.jpeg\"><u>bumblebee bat</u></a>\u2014and 40,000 times more massive.</p>\n<p>Moving beyond the realm of biology\u2014if we consider ourselves in relation to well-understood <i>objects</i>, we might make our endpoints a proton (10<sup>-16</sup>m) and the sun (10<sup>8</sup>m), in which case we&#8217;re much closer to the size of the sun than the size of a proton. Big again. But if we use the Milky Way (10<sup>20</sup>m) as our upper endpoint, then we become smaller than we are big.</p>\n<p>Then there&#8217;s the whole range of size. According to my <a class=\"contentLink\" href=\"https://shop-us.kurzgesagt.org/products/universe-in-a-nutshell-app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Universe in a Nutshell</a> app (plug!), the smallest known unit of space, the Planck length (maybe our universe&#8217;s pixel size), is about 10<sup>-35</sup>m. The largest space we can see is the observable universe, which is around 10<sup>26</sup>m range. If those are our endpoints, the midpoint between them would be a bit smaller than the width of a human hair\u2014making us bigger than we are small.</p>\n<p>But the observable universe is probably only a tiny piece of the full universe, and then there&#8217;s the multiverse if that&#8217;s a thing. So the real upper endpoint is probably high enough, if it exists at all, to make us much smaller than we are big.</p>\n<p>My takeaway here is that we&#8217;re extremely middling when it comes to size, which I guess isn&#8217;t the worst thing to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<p style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>How do I get over a breakup if I&#8217;m still in love?</strong> \u2013 <em>Anon</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s no way to make an excruciating loss not excruciating except time, and I&#8217;m sorry to hear about the excruciatingness you&#8217;re going through.</p>\n<p>Maybe it&#8217;ll help to remember that everyone you know, everyone you see on the street, everyone who&#8217;s ever lived in every place and time, has probably been there too or will be there in the future\u2014because excruciating loss is an unfortunate staple of the human experience.</p>\n<p>It might also help to remember that the part of you that feels like this wound will never heal is almost definitely wrong, and being wrong about that is also a staple of the human experience.

(New York, NY)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>NYC is an extreme place. It&#8217;s great at being exceptional and it&#8217;s great at being awful. It&#8217;s a high-priced filth bucket with great weather 25% of the time. It&#8217;s supposedly this world-leading city and yet it&#8217;s often behind the innovation curve and feels less futuristic than many other cities. The restaurants are world-class but it can also sometimes be hard to find a fresh salad for lunch. I could go on.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s also a place where within a 20-minute walk of my apartment I can find every cuisine in the world, every type of art, every kind of shop, and a million different cultural experiences (many in secret underground nooks). It feels like the entire <i>world</i> is crammed into this city.</p>\n<p>Among US cities, it&#8217;s not #1 for tech (SF), entertainment (LA), politics (DC), medicine (Boston), or a handful of other major industries. But it&#8217;s at least top 5 in <i>every </i>industry. NYC has <i>breadth </i>like nowhere else I know (at least in the US). This is especially appealing to me since I like to dig into a lot of totally different areas with my writing.</p>\n<p>On a me-specific level, it&#8217;s a place where a large portion of my friends and acquaintances live, and of those who don&#8217;t live here, a large portion come through the city at least once a year. Nowhere other than NYC would I be able to get this level of in-person contact with such a large percentage of people I care about. (It&#8217;s also a quick trip to Boston, where much of my family lives.)</p>\n<p>Finally, I really like the historical aspect. 300 years of human ingenuity gives a place a lot of character (I know that sounds paltry to non-Americans but it&#8217;s a big deal here!). Every street has an epic story to it. It makes the city like a big history museum to explore, and I like knowing that I&#8217;ll never even scratch the surface.</p>\n<p>The awful things about NYC suck. A lot. But for me at least, the good things make living here a clear net positive.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<p style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>How are you?

(Delhi, India)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think in most cases, we should feel fine loving the art we love, regardless of who the artist is, what they did, or what they believed. John Lennon was physically abusive in his early relationships. Picasso and Jackson Pollock were abusive husbands. Walt Disney wasn&#8217;t a fan of the Jews, nor is Cat Stevens. Ellen DeGeneres was a dick to her staff. Norman Mailer stabbed his wife. I could have listed 1,000 of these because artists are often messed up, unstable people who do or say bad things (and because <i>most</i> people secretly hold deep-down beliefs you would disapprove of if you knew about them). That a lot of great art emerges from troubled minds shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise or invalidate the art as great art to be enjoyed\u2014at least not to me.</p>\n<p>In many cases, we&#8217;re also talking about artists who lived in different times\u2014times when your own ancestors who lived then almost certainly were doing or saying some things that would make them &#8220;bad people&#8221; by today&#8217;s standards.</p>\n<p>For those who generally agree with me about this, there might still be exceptions. Maybe an important <i>part </i>of why you liked <em>The Cosby Show</em> was the belief that Bill Cosby really was a lot like Cliff Huxtable, and knowing what you know now, the show loses its charm. I just find those to be the rare exceptions, not the rule.</p>\n<p>Finally, I would say there are two okay views to have here: 1) my view, that you can enjoy art by people you disapprove of, and 2) the opposite view, that not liking the artist ruins the art. What&#8217;s not an okay view is 3) &#8220;Art by a person I disapprove of should be banned so that <i>no </i>one is allowed to consume it, and any platform that doesn&#8217;t ban it should be punished.&#8221; There&#8217;s way too much #3 going on right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<p style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>What countries were your absolute favorite travel experiences?</strong> \u2013<em>&nbsp;Samantha K.

I got really good at it and impressed lots of strangers and everything was great. Then, after a few weeks, the battery, though appearing to be half full, suddenly died and I wiped out in the middle of the street mortifyingly. I carried the board home and charged it up and pretended like nothing had happened and kept riding around. Then a few days later the battery died again out of nowhere and I wiped out mortifyingly in the street again. Turns out I had bought a cheap Chinese-made knockoff without realizing it. Bummer.</p>\n<p>I was gonna get a new one, this time online with some research and not from some shady fuck I met on the street\u2014but right around that time, NY decided it didn&#8217;t know what a hoverboard was and didn&#8217;t know how to categorize it or whether it should need a license or whether they should go in the bike lane or sidewalk and just shrugged and <a class=\"contentLink\" href=\"https://portal.311.nyc.gov/article/?kanumber=KA-02802\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">banned them</a>.

He had read a few WBW posts and offered me the opportunity to give a TED Talk at the 2016 conference (which was six months away). Immediately full of both gratitude/excitement and dread/anxiety, I asked him if it might be better to wait a couple years until I had some more speaking experience. He paused thoughtfully for a few seconds before saying, &#8220;There&#8217;s no time like the present.&#8221; I took his advice. Since then, his voice saying those words has popped into my head again and again during hard decisions, and I&#8217;m yet to regret following them.</p>\n<p>Great advice is sometimes great because it&#8217;s totally original or framed in an original way. But, as in my story, a well-known platitude, at the perfect <i>moment</i>, can also make a huge impact. What makes Chris&#8217;s advice so valuable to me wasn&#8217;t that it was something new\u2014it was that the lesson I learned from <i>taking</i> the advice in that particular moment turned a clich\u00e9 into a mantra.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<p style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>What are your thoughts on TikTok?</strong> \u2013 <em>Annie (Ontario, California)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a long time, TikTok was this impossibly annoying-seeming thing that wouldn&#8217;t go away.

(Windhoek, Namibia)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprisingly hard one. 11 feet seems like the obvious answer. You&#8217;re a full &#8220;thing&#8221; everywhere you go and everyone would flip out, but then they&#8217;d get used to it and you could still have an almost normal life. You could still have an almost normal house. You could for sure play in the NBA. You could still have sex.</p>\n<p>No one is fucking a nine-inch tall person. And you couldn&#8217;t go anywhere without everyone you&#8217;re about to see being fully prepped ahead of time for the situation. Your house would be a joke. That said, there would be benefits. You could sneak into anything and hide very easily. Like you could probably smuggle yourself on a plane to Russia without anyone noticing, sneak into the Kremlin, and listen in on the most secretive Putin meetings while hiding behind the curtains or somewhere. But then what?</p>\n<p>So I guess my answer is that the nine-inch-tall option would be very fun for a while but then when you got bored of the perks, you&#8217;d be confronted with your life as a pencil person and would probably regret the choice. So I&#8217;d go with 11 feet tall.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<p style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Can you suggest methods for dealing with the crushing realization that people you used to have a lot of respect for don&#8217;t hold the principles/values you thought they did and therefore might no longer be worthy of your respect?

The better I get to know people I&#8217;ve previously lionized, the more disappointed I become. This makes sense, because people are neither demons nor angels\u2014they&#8217;re humans. The crushing realization you&#8217;re experiencing is probably less some awful truths you&#8217;re learning about people you admire and more a truth you&#8217;re seeing about humans in general. Even the people you look up to are fallible and flawed\u2014but that doesn&#8217;t mean they can&#8217;t also be worthy of your love and respect.</p>\n<p>With all that in mind, I&#8217;d consider three things:</p>\n<p>First, take a hard look at ways you feel these people are disappointing you, and try asking whether your own judgments might be off. On more than one occasion, I&#8217;ve scoffed at those I once considered wise only to later realize that they weren&#8217;t all that wrong after all.</p>\n<p>Second, think about <i>all </i>the ways a human can be good and wise, and you&#8217;ll be reminded of certain ways these people are still very much worthy of your admiration. Focusing on those areas can restore the respect you want to feel towards them.</p>\n<p>Finally, where you do firmly believe you have something right that they don&#8217;t, remember that wisdom is a multi-generational collaboration. When mentorship works, it raises mentees to be <i>wiser</i> than the mentor\u2014mentees who can then be even better mentors to the next generation. This is how the wisdom trend slopes continually upwards. If your mentors are forever wiser than you, they failed as mentors. So when you do feel wiser, it&#8217;s not a bad thing\u2014it means it&#8217;s your turn to take the wisdom torch and try to bring it to the next level.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<p style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>What are your most left-wing, and most right-wing, <strong>political positions</strong>?</strong> \u2013 <em>Hannah J.

And instead of trying to suppress evidence that cigarettes are disastrous for your health, the big alcohol companies need to keep all the other fun drugs stigmatized and illegal\u2014and with tens of billions of dollars at stake, they&#8217;ll spend billions of dollars to keep the status quo the way it is.</p>\n<p>When I grew up, the rules were clear: if a party is a cool party, it has alcohol at it, and if you&#8217;re a cool person, you drink alcohol. If your party doesn&#8217;t have alcohol, it&#8217;s not a cool party, and if you don&#8217;t drink alcohol, you&#8217;re not a cool person. If you take a step back and think about it, that&#8217;s kinda weird. This one particular drug, of so many, has been deemed A) the socially acceptable, non-stigmatized one, and B) the definition of cool. Meanwhile, alcohol is just an alright drug\u2014probably a below average one\u2014while also being one of the<i> </i>most dangerous and harmful ones.

How have you increased the proportion and/or frequency of these conversations in your life?</strong> <em>\u2013 Andrew N. (London, UK)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that can go a long way: see the people you really like talking to more frequently. This is about more than the obvious point that doing so literally increases the cumulative time you&#8217;ll talk to them: When you don&#8217;t see someone frequently enough, every time you do hang out ends up being a big catch-up, where both of you update the other on your lives. This doesn&#8217;t seem like a problem until you consider that the whole relationship now mostly consists of catching each other up (and reminiscing about old times because you&#8217;re not making any <i>new </i>times together). This isn&#8217;t actually hanging out. Hanging out means shooting the shit about whatever&#8217;s on your mind and exploring new topics together. If I haven&#8217;t seen someone in forever and then they&#8217;re in town for a week and I see them twice, it&#8217;s the <i>second </i>hangout, with the catch-up out of the way, where the more interesting conversation usually happens.<a href=\"#footnote-10-9079\" id=\"note-10-9079\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a>\n<p>Two friends and I started zoom-chatting every Friday during covid and it just turned into a thing that now happens once a week, and the conversations are great because they&#8217;re free of big-picture catch-up\u2014they&#8217;re either about ongoing <i>keeping </i>up, or more often, just fun divergent conversation about third-party topics. If you have anyone you like talking to enough to do it a few times every month, try to make that happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<p style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Do you have some tips of where and/or <strong>how to meet people</strong> who tend to think more high-rung, both online and in real life?

The question is &#8211; how do you find other people who want to grow and exchange knowledge?</strong> \u2013 <em>Mikhail I. (Moscow, Russia)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three ideas:</p>\n<p><b>1) Mine people you already know for hidden high-rung-ness. </b>Sometimes two people get stuck in a dynamic where both feel like they have to agree with each other, which is kind of boring and stressful and makes it hard to dig deep and explore anything\u2014but neither one actually prefers it to be this way. They&#8217;re just stuck in a social rut. In this case, all it might take is one person actually starting to say what they really think and being willing to break the &#8220;disagreement&#8221; ice, and the whole relationship can transform into something much more interesting and high rung. Of course, there are plenty of other times when an Echo Chamber dynamic is in place because one or both people very much want it to be that way, and an attempt by one party to snap out of that will go over badly (btw, this isn&#8217;t the end of the world\u2014it just means that high-rung conversation won&#8217;t be a part of that relationship, you can still enjoy the rest of what it has to offer). If you do find that most of your existing relationships are stuck on the intellectual low rungs, you&#8217;ll want to supplement things with some new friendships that can better indulge your intellect. This is where the other two points come in.</p>\n<p><b>2) Collect high-rungers you happen upon in the wild. </b>Post-college-age people tend to be really bad at making new friends. But it doesn&#8217;t have to be this way. There will be moments\u2014at work, at a dinner party, at some event\u2014when you discover a super interesting-seeming person you really like talking to, and you wish you were friends with them. If you feel this way, there&#8217;s a decent chance they feel the same way about you.

(Pune, India)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing the Story of Us\u2014first as a series and now as a book\u2014has totally reshaped the way I think. The core mental model in the book has become a lens I use constantly. I&#8217;ve also learned a lot about politics, history, psychology, and sociology that I didn&#8217;t know before. My goal with the book is to take the most important parts of both the framework and the things I&#8217;ve learned and package it in a way that can resonate with many different kinds of minds and actually <i>stick</i>.

But now that you will be releasing a book, will you still need my support? What are your plans for the future?</strong> \u2013 <em>Kyros J.(Barcelona, Spain)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Here&#8217;s how I think about Patreon, from our side:</b></p>\n<p>Patreon is a means of creative freedom. Without Patreon, money would be a sizable part of our decision-making process. We&#8217;d have to take on sponsorships, sell products, and use paywalls, whether we felt good about it or not. Patreon allows us to do whatever we think actually makes sense for us and what we&#8217;re trying to do. It allows us to make a big list of potential projects and to prioritize them based on what we&#8217;re most excited about and what we think is the most important, not based on what will make the most money. Patreon means that we&#8217;ll do some projects that make money and others that won&#8217;t, and we don&#8217;t have to worry too much about which ones are which. It allows us to start a podcast without a sponsor and have the &#8220;we&#8217;ll get a sponsor if and when it feels right&#8221; attitude. It allows us to turn the Story of Us into a book, because it makes sense in this case, and to have turned down opportunities to make other post series into books, because it wasn&#8217;t something we felt made sense. It allows us to email readers about a product in our store only when we&#8217;re actually excited to tell them about that product. Having money as a secondary concern is an unbelievable creative luxury and one that makes Wait But Why a better place.</p>\n<p><b>Here&#8217;s how I think about Patreon, from your side:</b></p>\n<p>The independent internet creator is a pretty new kind of thing, and I think we&#8217;re all still figuring out the best ways for that to work, financially. Patreon gives regular readers three options:</p>\n<p>1) I like this person&#8217;s work, and I&#8217;d like to pay something for it</p>\n<p>2) I like this person&#8217;s work, and I&#8217;d like to pay something for it, but right now I can&#8217;t afford to</p>\n<p>3) I like this person&#8217;s work, but it&#8217;s not something I want to pay for</p>\n<p>The great thing about having a sizable audience is that if a small portion of our readers end up in Category 1, we&#8217;re covered. So far, that&#8217;s exactly what&#8217;s happened. Category 1 readers have combined to be an incredibly<i> </i>important support for us and provide that treasured creative freedom I talked about.</p>\n<p>But that also means that we&#8217;re <i>totally cool </i>with Categories 2 and 3.</p>\n<p>People in Category 2, who would like to support us but don&#8217;t have the budget to spare: not only is that okay, but please know that the last thing I want is for WBW support to be an uncomfortable or stressful expense in your life. I love the idea of WBW being free for people who are only able to consume free content at a given time in their lives.</p>\n<p>People in Category 3, who simply prefer to put their dollars towards other causes, please continue doing so. This is the cool thing about the voluntary donation model\u2014only some people have to do it for it to work perfectly. Category 1 has everyone else covered.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been a Category 1 supporter of ours, huge hug, we love you, and we&#8217;re endlessly grateful. You should also never feel weird or guilty about stopping. Supporting us doesn&#8217;t have to mean supporting us forever. Once a Category 1er, always a Category 1er, no matter when you stop.</p>\n<p>Finally, Patreon is only one way to support WBW. There&#8217;s also buying stuff we sell and, probably most important, sharing WBW with others.</p>\n<p><strong>As for the future of Wait But Why:</strong></p>\n<p>At the moment, it&#8217;s hard to imagine a time when I will want to be doing anything other than creating new things on this platform. My &#8220;future topics list&#8221; is longer than I could ever get through in one life, and as long as I&#8217;m curious, I&#8217;ll be working my way through it.</p>\n<p>Within that broader picture, there are a ton of fun possibilities. We plan to expand the platform from just writing to writing, audio, and video. We want to keep trying new things and new collaborations (like the <a class=\"contentLink\" href=\"https://shop-us.kurzgesagt.org/products/universe-in-a-nutshell-app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">app</a> we made with <a class=\"contentLink\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kurzgesagt</a>). We want to dig in deeper with the community with more in-person events. We&#8217;ve sketched out plans for a new, much better site.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a slow few years as I&#8217;ve worked on a single, big project, but my excitement and energy have never been higher. I hope I&#8217;m still making good things when I&#8217;m 80 and I hope you&#8217;re still here with me.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p>If you like Wait But Why, sign up for our unannoying-I-promise <strong><a class=\"ClickPico PicoRule\" href=\"https://mailchi.mp/waitbutwhy/email-signup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">email list</a></strong>&nbsp;and we\u2019ll send you new posts when they come out.</p>\n<p>To support Wait But Why,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/waitbutwhy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>visit our Patreon page</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>For my daily musings, follow WBW on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/waitbutwhy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Twitter</strong></a> and <strong><a href=\"https://instagram.com/waitbutwhy\">Instagram</a></strong>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Other places to go:</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\"><strong><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/05/mailbag-1.html\">Mailbag #1</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\"><strong><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/07/odd-things-odd-places-intro.html\">The Travel Series</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:17px\"><strong><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/03/procrastination-matrix.html\">The Procrastination Matrix</a></strong></p>\n\n\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"><hr /><ol><li id=\"footnote-1-9079\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Depending on how transparent viruses are, we might need to stack a bunch of these virus squares to make it opaque enough to see, which would raise the total number of viruses needed into the millions or even billions.<a href=\"#note-1-9079\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-1.footnote--><li id=\"footnote-2-9079\" class=\"footnote\"><p>The NIH does <a class=\"contentLink\" href=\"https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-human-microbiome-project-defines-normal-bacterial-makeup-body\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">note</a> that most of the human cells are red blood cells (a further rabbit hole reminded me that red blood cells look like <a class=\"contentLink\" href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=red+blood+cells&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk01fL1df9ojB10ZGMzPYFILbbKbCug:1617579053371&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjUy_zG3-XvAhXSMd8KHaUYDmoQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;biw=1664&amp;bih=1257\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">delicious gummy candy</a>), and they admit that red blood cells are kind of just \u201cbags full of hemoglobin.&#8221; If you only count human cells with a nucleus, the ratio <i>is</i> 10 bacteria for every human cell.<a href=\"#note-2-9079\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-2.footnote--><li id=\"footnote-3-9079\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Zachary got more than he bargained for here.<a href=\"#note-3-9079\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-3.footnote--><li id=\"footnote-4-9079\" class=\"footnote\"><p>As a one-time budding film composer, it used to be stressful playing the score I had written for the director the first time.

Two teams, everyone writes down names on little slips of paper, folds them and puts them into a big communal bowl (one name on each slip), and each team also has their own empty bowl. You want about 40 names total, so if it&#8217;s a 2-on-2 game, everyone should put 10 names in the bowl each. If it&#8217;s 5-on-5, everyone should do four names. Names can be celebrities, friends of the people playing, or famous fictional characters\u2014you can go a little obscure but you want at least half of the group to know each name. There are three rounds. In the first round, Person 1 on Team A starts &#8211; they have one minute &#8211; they pick a name out of the bowl and say whatever they want (other than stupid cheats like saying &#8216;the name rhymes with Ill Pinton!&#8217; and no doing impressions or pointing at anything &#8211; just verbal description) &#8211; when one of their teammates successfully calls out the name, they put the piece of paper into their team&#8217;s bowl and pick the next name. After a minute their turn is up and the name in their hand goes back into the big bowl. Teams alternate and who the name-picker is on each team alternates with each turn. When all the names are out, Round 1 is over. Names in each team&#8217;s bowl are tallied up and the score is written down. Then all the names go back into the big bowl. Round 2 is the same as round 1 except the name-picker can only say one word now. No facial expressions or anything. One word and then they have to go blank and hope it&#8217;s enough for their team to get it. Round 3 is like the other 2 rounds except no words now &#8211; just silent acting. Usually that&#8217;s the end but if you wanna get weird, bonus round 4 is the same as round 3 except the name-picker now has a bed sheet over their entire head and body, like a kid in a ghost costume. The team with the highest cumulative score in the 3 (or 4) rounds wins. Only other rule is that if in round 1, the name-picker doesn&#8217;t know the name, they can&#8217;t pass, so they can try to get it using other tricks &#8220;first name is the same name as the first U.S. president, etc.&#8221; or they can challenge. When a player challenges, the timer stops, they say the name, and whoever knows who that person is raises their hand. If fewer than half the other players know the name, the name-picker counts the name as a point and it goes into their team&#8217;s bowl, the timer is started where it left off, and the turn continues. If half or more of the people know the name, the other team gets that name in their bowl and the player&#8217;s turn then continues. Those who don&#8217;t know the name need to learn it then because in future rounds there are no challenges.<a href=\"#note-9-9079\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-9.footnote--><li id=\"footnote-10-9079\" class=\"footnote\"><p>It&#8217;s always an option to just skip the big catch-up with friends you don&#8217;t see very often, but that&#8217;s not great either because it&#8217;s hard to be close when you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on with someone.<a href=\"#note-10-9079\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-10.footnote--><li id=\"footnote-11-9079\" class=\"footnote\"><p>A less risky option if your mammoth is flipping out is to invite the person to a gathering you&#8217;re organizing.<a href=\"#note-11-9079\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-11.footnote--></ol></div><!--/#footnotes--><div class=\"footnotes2\"><hr /><ol><li id=\"footnote2-1-9079\" class=\"footnote2\"><p><a class=\"contentLink\" href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Our World in Data</a><a href=\"#note2-1-9079\" class=\"footnote2-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote2-1.footnote--></ol></div><!--/#footnotes2--><p>The post <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2021/04/mailbag-2.html\">Mailbag #2</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com\">Wait But Why</a>.</p>\n\nhttps://waitbutwhy.com/2021/04/mailbag-2.html/feed\n171\n9079 \n\nThe Trump-Biden Debate\nhttps://waitbutwhy.com/2020/09/debate2020.html\n\t\t\t\t\thttps://waitbutwhy.com/2020/09/debate2020.html#comments\nTim Urban\nWed, 30 Sep 2020 14:58:09 +0000\nUncategorized\nfunny\npolitics\nhttps://waitbutwhy.com/?p=9026\n<p>In case you missed it...</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2020/09/debate2020.html\">The Trump-Biden Debate</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com\">Wait But Why</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>In case you missed it, here\u2019s a transcript of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cathmZFeXs&amp;ab_channel=NBCNews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">first Trump-Biden Debate</a>:</p>\n<p><strong>Chris Wallace: </strong>Good evening. I\u2019m Chris Wallace and I welcome you to what I predict will be a very bad personal experience for me. There will be six 15-minute segments, each on a different topic. At the beginning of each segment, both candidates will get two uninterrupted minutes to respond. The remainder of the segment will be open discussion. The audience has agreed not to be trashy. Both campaigns have signed off on these rules, so for sure nothing will go wrong. And with that, let\u2019s welcome the candidates.</p>\n[CANDIDATES ENTER]\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Let\u2019s start with the Supreme Court. President Trump, you nominated Amy Coney Barrett to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the court. You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation to nominate someone to the court. Vice President Biden, you&#8217;ve called this an abuse of power. To start, why don\u2019t you both explain your positions.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Amy Coney Barrett is a perfect nominee. Conservatives love her. Liberals love her. Chris Wallace loves her.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>Amy Barrett would repeal the Affordable Care Act. And besides, the new thing is that you have to wait until after the election to nominate someone.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Not sure what you&#8217;re talking about, because last I checked a presidential term is four years, not three. You want to instate Communist medicine.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>I don\u2019t want to instate Communist medicine. I want to expand Obamacare.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Your party wants to instate Communist medicine, and you\u2019re scared of them.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>I may be scared of them but I <em>am</em> the Democrat Party now, so even if I was and still am scared of them, I\u2019m not anymore. They\u2019ll do what I say now. And how about Covid? The president killed 200,000 people. Roe v. Wade.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>You would have killed 2 million people by not banning China. Not Roe v. Wade.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>K let\u2019s go back to healthcare for a minute. Mr. President, over the past four years you have promised to replace and repeal Obamacare, but you have never in these four years come up\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Yes I have.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>with a plan\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Of course I have.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>to\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Of course I have.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>replace\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>I got rid of the individual mandate.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Oba\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>The individual mandate was a joke.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>macare.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>The individual mandate was the worst part of Obamacare.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>I am the moder\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>The individual mandate sucks dick.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>I AM THE MODERATOR of this debate and I would like to be treated as such. You have never come up with a plan to replace Obamacare. So what is the Trump healthcare plan?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>I\u2019m cutting drug prices. Insulin is like water.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Uh huh. How about you Joe? Why do you want to end private insurance?</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>I don\u2019t want to end private insurance.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>You\u2019re literally friends with Bernie Sanders.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>No I\u2019m not. I want to\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>You\u2019re a piece of shit Joe.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>I want to make sure\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>A sad little man.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Stop picking on Joe, Mr. President.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>You care deeply about Bernie Sanders. You like Communist medicine. Anyway I asked the doctors and they said Obamacare is a disaster.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>He doesn\u2019t have a plan.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Changing gears, Joe some of your colleagues are talking about ending the filibuster and packing the court. What\u2019s your stance on that?</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>My stance is that voting is good. Americans should vote. It\u2019s easy. You just go to the polling place, you wait in line, and then you go into the booth, and you push the little switch down for the candidate you want to vote for. Sometimes it\u2019s not a switch.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>You gonna pack the court, Joe? Tell us about how you\u2019re gonna pack the court, Joe. The radical Left is pulling your puppet strings Joe. You and I both know it Joe.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>Shut up, man.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>This is going well. Okay next segment. Covid-19. There have been more than 7 million cases in the United States and more than 200,000 have died. The question is, why should people trust you more than your opponent to handle this public health crisis?</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>40,000 people a day contracting Covid. 200,000 people dead. He has no plan. He knew in February. He lied. He panicked. He complimented China. He has no plan. He\u2019s playing golf.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>I saved lives. It\u2019s China\u2019s fault. You wanted to let Chinese people come here. Dr. Fauci and all the Democrat governors said, \u201cPresident Trump did a phenomenal job.\u201d And they\u2019re not the only ones. All of the other people said it too. \u201cPresident Trump did a phenomenal job,\u201d they all said. I did a phenomenal job. The gowns, the masks, the ventilators, you don\u2019t know how to make a ventilator, the vaccine is here, any week now. You could never have done the job I did because you\u2019re a random old man. You couldn\u2019t even do swine flu. Swine flu is a disaster.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong> He panicked. People died. And more people are gonna die unless he gets a lot smarter\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Did you just use the word smart? You lied about going to college at Delaware State. You were the worst student at Delaware State. You\u2019re a dumb fuck Joe. I know it. Chris Wallace knows it don\u2019t you Chris.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Trump:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Biden:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Mr. President, you have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks. Are you not in favor of masks?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Masks are tremendous. I have a mask right here in my pocket. I wear masks when needed. Masks have said I\u2019ve done a phenomenal job. Joe wears masks even when it makes no sense. He wears them when he\u2019s 200 feet away from me. He wears a mask when he\u2019s sleeping.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Mr. Vice President, is that true?</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>If you wanna open a business, you gotta have a plan.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Sir, I was asking about masks.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>Oh masks? Sure, you gotta have a mask.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Alright next segment. The economy. Mr. Trump, you go first.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>It\u2019s a big dick economy.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>No.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Okay how about taxes. Mr. President, apparently you pay $750 a year in taxes. There\u2019s a girl my daughter knows who\u2019s 15 and she works in a movie theater on Sundays and sells the candy. And she pays more than $750 a year in taxes. So is this true, Mr. President? How much did you pay in taxes in 2016 and 2017?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Miyyons.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Miyyons, sir?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Miyyons and Biyyons. I don\u2019t pay taxes because the Obama administration said I didn\u2019t have to.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Joe, what\u2019s your plan for taxes?</p>\n<p><strong>Biden:</strong> I\u2019m gonna build this economy. I\u2019m gonna make jobs. We\u2019re gonna buy American. We\u2019re gonna buy American ships. American steel. American buildings. We handed him a booming economy and he blew it.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>But did you actually hand him a booming economy and did he actually blow it?</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>Sure, whatever. He talks about the art of the deal. China has perfected the art of the steal.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>China buttered your son\u2019s belly.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>China did no such thing.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>And then, Joe? You know what happened after that? Your son went to Moscow. And you know what happened there Joe? Moscow buttered your son\u2019s belly.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>Nothing happened there.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Sure did Joe. The mayor of Moscow\u2019s wife. She buttered his belly slick.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>You wanna talk about families Trump? How about your family. With their grease and their shoes. It\u2019s not about families. It\u2019s about the American people. It\u2019s about families.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Oh and how about Ukraine?</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>You know what? Time to move on to\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Ukraine buttered the shit out of\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Mr. President.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Ukraine buttered him up real good.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Mr. <em>President</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Shut your mouth Chris. What about Ukraine Joe?</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace:</strong> VAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH</p>\n<p><strong>Trump:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Now I\u2019m gonna say something and I want you to listen right to me, Mr. President. I have had it up to here with you. Any more misbehaving and I will put you in timeout.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>And you know what else\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>I will put you <em>right in timeout</em>, Mr. President. And then you\u2019ll be sorry. Now I want you to stop being a bad boy, is that clear?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>How about him? He should get timeout too.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Well frankly, Mr. President, you\u2019ve been the badder boy.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>He\u2019s been plenty bad.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>For the next segment, we\u2019ll be talking about race. Why should voters trust you to deal with the race issues facing this country? Mr. Vice President, we\u2019ll start with you.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>I\u2019m all for race. It\u2019s about equity. About equality. About equanimity. Equilibrium. Equinox. We need to fix the systemic equity of racism and fragility in this country. And this president has done none of that. He wants to fix the systemic equity of the Nazis.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>The blacks love me. Everyone knows that the blacks love me. I have blacks come up to me on the street all the time and tell me they love me. Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass and I have done more for the blacks than Joe could ever dream of. Joe won\u2019t say law enforcement. Why won\u2019t you say it Joe? Why are you such a puppet Joe? You\u2019re the radical Left\u2019s toy. You\u2019re a yo-yo. The radical Left won\u2019t let you say law enforcement because they bounce you like a yo-yo, Joe.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>I want to turn to the subject of protests. In many cities, things have turned violent. Portland, for instance, is a certifiable madhouse. Mr. Biden, have you ever called the mayor of Portland or the governor of Oregon and been like, \u201cwtf?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>I don\u2019t have their numbers. Otherwise I would have. Do you have their numbers Chris? If you do, text them to me. And besides, they\u2019re taking care of things just fine.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Yeah Joe? They\u2019re fine? They\u2019re literally murdering people in the streets, which is a disaster, and no one in Portland cares.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Mr. President do you like or not like white supremacists?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>No of course not. I don\u2019t not like, or don\u2019t not not like any of the people.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Mr. President, what is your message to white supremacists?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Get your guns but don\u2019t fire till I give the word. Anyway the Left is committing 99% of the violence right now.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>Oh baloney. Antifa is an idea, not an organization. I heard it means anti-fascist, in which case heck, sign me up. And anyhow who hasn\u2019t thrown urine at an old lady on a bad day? The Antifas are just like you and me.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>I\u2019m having an awful time here. I\u2019m really upset and I want to leave and I\u2019m having a bad, bad time. For the next segment, let\u2019s just go with \u201cwhy should you be president over your opponent?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>There has never been a leader who has done more than I\u2019ve done. And I don\u2019t mean just U.S. presidents. Mandela. Attila the Hun. Caesar. King Tut. None of them did as much as I\u2019ve done. I unified this country. For the first time in U.S. history, I ended division. I have the first 100% approval rating. And how about judges. I have 300 judges. I have judges up the ass, Chris. You know why? Because Obama and crazy Uncle Joe forgot to fill the seats. Who does that. No one does that. You forget your keys, sure I\u2019ve forgotten my keys, I\u2019m human, we all forget our keys, sometimes I leave my keys. But leaving judges is a disaster.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>This man has made the country weaker, sicker, poorer, fatter, sloppier, and slipperier. When I was Vice President I went head-to-head with Putin, but Trump is Putin\u2019s little puppy. His cuddle-bunny. His bushy-bushy-boo-boo.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>At least Putin\u2019s not my sugar daddy, like he is to your son.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>K speaking of that, fuck off. Second, you talk about the military being losers\u2014my son was in Iraq and he was no loser, he was a patriot.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Which son, the loser or the dead one?</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Wallace:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>I don\u2019t know the dead one, but if I recall, the loser got thrown out of the military, dishonorably discharged for having a nice time with his cocaine, only to then head off on his famous belly-buttering tour.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>His belly is dry!</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Oh for fuck\u2019s sake. Let\u2019s move on to climate change. Mr. President, what do you believe about the science of climate change, and what is your plan to confront it?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>I want clean water and air. As far as the California fires are concerned, the forest floors are full of dead trees and leaves.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Okay but what do you believe about the science of climate change?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>I want clean water and air. I\u2019ve planted a biyyon trees. We\u2019ve got to pick the leaves up in the forest in California. Every year I get the call. California\u2019s burning again. Because again they didn\u2019t pick up the fucking leaves. You know in Europe, they pick up leaves.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Joe?</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>I want to get rid of fossil fuel plants and invest in renewable energy. I want to transition to electric cars and make green buildings and create millions of new jobs.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>He\u2019s talking about the Green New Deal. The 55 quadrillion dollar Green New Deal.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>The Green New Deal is a plan that\u2019ll pay for itself. It\u2019ll work great.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Do you support the Green New Deal?</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>Of course not. I\u2019m talking about the Biden Plan. Who said anything about the Green New Deal?</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Mercifully, we\u2019ve reached the final segment of my extremely awful night. Election integrity. How confident should we be that this will be a fair election?</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>There is no evidence that mail-in ballots are problematic. Trump is trying to convince people not to vote. Listen to me America. Get out there and vote. If I get enough votes, this whole thing is over and the bad man can\u2019t hurt you. It doesn\u2019t matter what he says, if I get enough votes he\u2019s legit not in power anymore, how rad is that.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Mr. President?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>A squirrel\u2019s ass, Chris. That\u2019s where someone found a ballot the other day. A squirrel shit out a ballot in a park in Philadelphia and a man picked it up and guess what? It said Trump on the ballot. Big shocker there. This is what happens with mail-in ballots. They end up in a trash can in a river in the woods in the backcountry and then eventually the trash can gets caught up in an eddy, we both know how eddies work Chris, and it washes up on the bank, and then a squirrel gets into it and eats the ballots. Half the country\u2019s ballots have already been found in eddies and in squirrels, and all of them were votes for me. Mail-in ballots are a fraud.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>One thing we all know for sure is that this election is going to be a shitshow. Will you accept the results of the shitshow and tell your supporters to accept the results peacefully?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>If there\u2019s no fraud, yes.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Is there any foreseeable outcome where you lose and you don\u2019t say it\u2019s fraud?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>No. I\u2019ve already talked about the squirrels. If I lose, we\u2019ll need to end the country.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Biden?</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>The country can go on if I lose.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>And that concludes what will end up as a stain on my career even though it clearly wasn\u2019t my fault.

I just gave you a tour of my house, where I spend a large portion of my life thinking about the size of things.</p>\n<p>I have visitors in the fun room from time to time, but after a few minutes, they\u2019re usually pretty funned out and leave me to my crises. But one day, something unexpected happened.</p>\n<p>It was 2013. Wait But Why was a few months old. And I got an email from someone named Philipp Dettmer. I was slightly unsettled by the pp and tt, but I decided to read what he had to say.</p>\n<p>He explained that he lives in Germany where he makes animated educational videos about a lot of different things, kind of like Wait But Why but a different medium. I took a look at his YouTube page. It was named a random string of letters:</p>\n<p>kurzgesagt</p>\n<p>Apparently it means \u201cIn a Nutshell\u201d in German, but I didn\u2019t know that at the time and was <em>very </em>close to being done with Philipp Dettmer for good when I decided to watch one of the videos.</p>\n<p>It was <em>delightful</em>.</p>\n<p>I watched another. And another. And then it hit me.</p>\n<p>Philipp\u2014this random man in Germany\u2014<em>also lives in the fun room.</em></p>\n<p>The next day, we were on the phone. There was a lot to talk about. We decided we had to do something together, and we settled on adapting <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/08/putting-time-in-perspective.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one of my early posts</a> into a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XkV6IpV2Y0&amp;ab_channel=Kurzgesagt%E2%80%93InaNutshell\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">kurzgesagt video</a>.<a href=\"#footnote-1-8973\" id=\"note-1-8973\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a>\n<p>In the seven years since then, Philipp and I have become great friends, and I have not missed a kurzgesagt video since. Whenever Philipp and I get dinner, we head straight to the fun room to talk about the universe. And a few months ago, we decided to collaborate again. It was time to go public with the fun room.</p>\n<p>At some point in our pasts, we had both become enamored with two fun room icons, Cary and Michael Huang, known on the internet as the Huang Twins. The twins do <a href=\"https://www.htwins.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a lot of cool things</a>, but it was their <a href=\"https://www.htwins.net/scale2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scale of the Universe</a> toy that we loved most.</p>\n<p>Inspired by their work, we decided to go for it. We wanted to make the best size explorer we could imagine. We called it Universe in a Nutshell.</p>\n<p>Of course, it took roughly 18 times longer than we thought it would. We brainstormed the interface for quite some time, and then Philipp, along with the incredible kurzgesagt team, dug into working on illustrations and animations, while I worked with the team on the written explainers.</p>\n<p>Thousands of human hours later, the app is done. 250 objects, 30,000+ words of explanations and fun facts, just the right mood music, and what we think is a pretty great interface.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how it works:</p>\n<p>The app is a giant wall. The wall is impossibly large\u2014large enough to fit full-sized galaxies on it. The wall is also impossibly high-resolution\u2014hi-res enough to contain sharp images of subatomic particles.</p>\n<p>I know it seems weird that I\u2019m talking about it as if it\u2019s a real object, but I have a good reason: to get the full mind-blow effect, you have to realize what you\u2019re looking at.

As this is V1, we of course also want to know whenever you have a \u201cThis isn\u2019t working right\u201d or an \u201cI think this fact is off\u201d thought. In the app\u2019s menu, you\u2019ll see a \u201cfeedback\u201d tab, where you can tap the feedback <a href=\"mailto:appfeedback@kurzgesagt.org\">email address</a> and let us know what you\u2019re thinking.</p>\n<p>Okay, here you go. <strong>Click the left app for iPhone/iPad, the right one for Android.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image-map-pro-image-map-pro\"><div id=\"image-map-pro-3124\"></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:29px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"appStores\"><div id=\"image-map-pro-5888\"></div></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</div>\n<p><strong>Also: </strong>To commemorate the app launch, Kurzgesagt did their own fun room creation today\u2014<a href=\"https://youtu.be/3mnSDifDSxQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>a delightful video about the sizes of stars</strong></a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p>\n<p><strong>End things:</strong></p>\n<p>If you like Wait But Why, sign up for our unannoying-I-promise <strong><a class=\"ClickPico PicoRule\" href=\"https://mailchi.mp/waitbutwhy/email-signup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">email list</a></strong>&nbsp;and we\u2019ll send you new posts when they come out.</p>\n<p>To support Wait But Why,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/waitbutwhy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>visit our Patreon page</strong></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>More trips to the fun room:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>The Fermi Paradox</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>The SpaceX Post</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/what-does-quadrillion-sour-patch-kids.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>The Quadrillion Sour Patch Kids Post</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/11/1000000-grahams-number.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>And a trip to the not-so-fun room</strong></a></p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"><hr /><ol><li id=\"footnote-1-8973\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Kurzgesagt did an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TbUxGZtwGI&amp;ab_channel=Kurzgesagt%E2%80%93InaNutshell\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">updated version of the video</a> in 2018.<a href=\"#note-1-8973\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-1.footnote--></ol></div><!--/#footnotes--><p>The post <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2020/09/universe.html\">The Big and the Small</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com\">Wait But Why</a>.</p>\n\nhttps://waitbutwhy.com/2020/09/universe.html/feed\n163\n8973 \n\nYou Won\u2019t Believe My Morning\nhttps://waitbutwhy.com/2020/03/my-morning.html\n\t\t\t\t\thttps://waitbutwhy.com/2020/03/my-morning.html#comments\nTim Urban\nWed, 25 Mar 2020 21:50:20 +0000\nUncategorized\nfiction\nmath\nmedical\nhttps://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8917\n<p>A highly unexpected turn of events.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2020/03/my-morning.html\">You Won&#8217;t Believe My Morning</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com\">Wait But Why</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You won\u2019t believe my morning.</p>\n<p>I went out on my daily excursion to sit on the front step of my building for ten minutes holding my breath when people walked by. Normally, I spend the time diddling around my phone, but I forgot to bring my phone this morning, so I just looked around.</p>\n<p>As I was taking in the emptiness of the street, a little glint caught my eye in a patch of dirt on the sidewalk. I bent over to look closer, and there was the glint again. It wasn\u2019t a normal glint like from a shiny rock or a piece of metal\u2014it was a little pinprick of flashing light.</p>\n<p>Intrigued, I was now on all fours looking closer. And I saw the most surreal thing.</p>\n<p><em>Tiny houses.</em></p>\n<p>Like <em>tiny </em>houses. Each about a millimeter high, like ornately carved grains of sand.</p>\n<p>I was either dreaming or looking at the coolest, <em>cutest </em>little art project ever.</p>\n<p>As I examined the microscopic village, I noticed what looked like a scrawl of teeny letters on the dirt next to the houses. It said:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">PUT YOUR THUMB ON THE OVAL</p>\n<p>Now fully having the time of my life, I looked around for an oval. I searched for a few minutes with no luck until I saw, a bit outside the area where the houses were, a little strip of silver, maybe two millimeters long and a millimeter wide. Careful not to damage the houses, I put my thumb on it.</p>\n<p>I won\u2019t be able to accurately describe what happened next, but I\u2019ll try my best. Imagine if the ground underneath you suddenly felt like a furiously spinning liquid whirlpool, combined with the feeling of freefalling, combined with your entire visual field turning into a blurry gray, combined with the worst nausea of your life.</p>\n<p>And then, just as fast as it started, it all stopped. I cowered for a few seconds trying to catch my breath, and when I opened my eyes, I wasn\u2019t in New York anymore.</p>\n<p>I was on a pastoral ranch, surrounded by big log cabins and a bunch of people staring down at me as I looked up at them, still on all fours. One of the people said to me, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel okay, but I\u2019m having <em>severe </em>hallucinations.\u201d</p>\n<p>They all started cheering and hugging and high-fiving each other.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you doctors?\u201d I asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe thinks he has the virus,\u201d one of them said, and they all roared with laughter.</p>\n<p>A woman shushed the crowd and said, \u201cOkay, back to work everyone. I\u2019ll give him the briefing.\u201d</p>\n<p>The others left, and the woman smiled at me. \u201cI\u2019m Layla.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi Layla. Do I have coronavirus?\u201d I asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have coronavirus,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re just tiny. We shrunk you to 1/10,000<sup>th</sup> of your normal size. You haven\u2019t moved anywhere, you\u2019ve just gotten much smaller.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I explained.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I imagine it\u2019s a lot to take in,\u201d she said. \u201cLet me try to clear things up. There are different tiers of human life, not just the one you\u2019re used to. Our tier is exactly 1/10,000<sup>th</sup> the size of yours. In yours, people are about 180 centimeters tall. Here, we\u2019re about 0.18 millimeters tall. We\u2019d say 180 micrometers tall, but I know in your world, micrometers don\u2019t mean very much.\u201d</p>\n<p>I stared at her. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me I\u2019m 0.18 millimeters tall right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCorrect,\u201d she said. \u201cAbout half the size of a dust mite, or a little taller than the width of a human hair up in your world. A person in your world with really good eyesight could <em>barely </em>see you, if they looked closely. And see that house over there?&#8221; She pointed to a large, three-story house. \u201cIn the scale you\u2019re used to, that would be about 10 meters high. Here, it\u2019s about the size of a cubic millimeter\u2014the size of a grain of sand on the sidewalk. Some of our houses were actually carved from grains of sand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHold on.\u201d I stopped her. \u201cI\u2019m <em>very </em>scared of bugs. I wrote a whole post about it once. Are there <em>giant </em>bugs here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes and no. There are no bugs in our village because we lined the perimeter with a poison that kills any insects that come too close. But you wouldn\u2019t want to walk too far away from the houses\u2014about three centimeters from here, you\u2019ll cross that barrier and run into things you won\u2019t like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow about flying bugs?\u201d I asked diligently.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I haven\u2019t mentioned time yet. Okay so time here moves 100 times faster than it does up on your tier. Time scales up inversely with the square root of the size difference. So 1/10,000<sup>th</sup> of the size means 100X faster time. So when a flying insect starts to descend into the village, our defense crew has over a minute here to handle the situation. They fire a jet of air at the insect that deflects it away from us. Same deal for dogs. Every year or two, a dog will pee on us. The defense crew keeps track of every dog walking by. At 1/100<sup>th</sup> the speed of our world, we first see an approaching dog about ten minutes before it gets near us, and by the time a peeing dog is lifting its leg over us, we\u2019ve had plenty of time to draw the tarps, which roll over the entire village and cover everything\u2014the same tarps we use every time it rains or snows.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood to know. But why am I here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, I was about to get to that. After a heated debate in the village, we voted to bring someone from your world here, because we wanted to show you something. We\u2019ve been trying to catch someone\u2019s eye in your world for three of your weeks. That\u2019s almost <em>six years </em>here. That\u2019s why everyone was so excited to see you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you catch my attention?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith <em>that</em>.\u201d She pointed at a tube on the roof of one of the houses that looked like large telescope. \u201cThat\u2019s a super-powered laser that we\u2019ve been trying to shine in people\u2019s eyes as they walked by on the sidewalk. But no one noticed. Until today. Way out on the horizon, we piled boulders into the shapes of letters that spelled out the instructions, and you were dicking around just hard enough that you actually bent down to read them. We\u2019re thankful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was that oval in the instructions?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook down.\u201d</p>\n<p>I was standing on a metallic oval about the size of a swimming pool.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is our trans-tier station. When you touched this with your thumb, it shrunk you down to our tier.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait.\u201d I looked up at her. \u201cDo I <em>live</em> here now?\u201d</p>\n<p>She laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll send you back to your world in a little bit. Now come with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>I walked with Layla towards the other side of the village. I looked around. Everyone was staring at me. Some people waved.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I asked Layla, pointing up at what looked like a sheet of color stretching into the sky.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s your apartment building. All you can see from here is the first brick. That band of light way up in the sky is the mortar between the first and second brick in the wall.\u201d</p>\n<p>We walked into a small building and entered a room with a long white table in the middle. Layla turned towards a wall on the side of the room, and suddenly the outline of a square formed in the wall. The square moved outwards into the room and rotated downwards until it was parallel to the floor. Layla pulled a tweezer-like tool from her pocket and carefully pinched what looked like nothing a few centimeters above the panel.</p>\n<p>She walked over to me. \u201cOpen your palm.\u201d</p>\n<p>She put her tweezers into my hand and dropped something the size of a grain of sand. I raised up my palm to look at it. It was reddish and fuzzy.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cSARS-CoV-2. What you&#8217;ve been calling &#8216;coronavirus.&#8217;\u201d</p>\n<p>I flung it across the room. \u201cWhat the <em>fuck</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Layla laughed, touched the square, and the little object flew back across the room into its spot above the square.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt can\u2019t hurt you here. The viruses of your world are <em>way </em>too big to do any damage in our bodies.\u201d</p>\n<p>I stared at her, trying to process the situation. \u201cHow do you know about coronavirus? And how did you\u2026<em>get </em>one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh we know everything about your world. Your tier moves so slowly compared to ours that your technology is eons behind ours. Our tools have allowed us to watch your world since your prehistoric days. As for how we got a coronavirus particle, we didn\u2019t get it\u2014we <em>made </em>it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You </em>made the coronavirus?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, with a little help. Follow me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Again I followed Layla, again dumbfounded, this time out of the building toward a fenced-in area outside. When we got close, a door in the fence opened and inside, we stood together on the edge of what looked like a barren circle of land.</p>\n<p>Layla opened her hand. The little virus was sitting neatly on her palm. \u201cSARS-CoV-2 is a standard sized Coronavirus\u2014about 120 nanometers in diameter. 120 nanometers is ridiculously small in your world, but in ours, you can roll it around in your fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cCool\u2026let me think about that for a minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, I can explain this better. In your world, this is a perfect size analogy:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">SARS-CoV-2 : grain of sand :: grain of sand : house</p>\n<p>In both cases, the relationship is 1-to-10,000, which is also the relationship of our world to yours. In your world, your apartment building is huge, a grain of sand is tiny, and this coronavirus is unfathomably microscopic. In ours, the virus is tiny, a grain of your sand is huge enough to live in, and your apartment building is unfathomably large.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMakes sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, what\u2019s a virus made of? Atoms. And atoms are about 0.1 nanometers in diameter\u2014about 1/1,000<sup>th</sup> of the diameter of a SARS-CoV-2 particle. That\u2019s small even for <em>us.</em> An atom is almost as small for us as a virus is for you. Constructing a virus requires incredibly complex engineering and tools that can interact with the quantum field. We can\u2019t do it ourselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo how\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook down.\u201d</p>\n<p>I looked at the ground.</p>\n<p>She pulled me toward the center of the circle of land and then pulled me to an abrupt stop.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook closer.\u201d</p>\n<p>I bent over as far as I could and strained my eyes. No. Fucking. Way.</p>\n<p><em>Another microscopic world</em>.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cIs that</em>\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYup. That\u2019s the tier below <em>us</em>. Give me your thumb.\u201d</p>\n<p>She carefully placed the virus particle onto the ground. Then she guided my hand to the ground, touching both of our thumbs to a little metallic spot.</p>\n<p>Whirlpool. Falling. Gray. Nausea. Misery.</p>\n<p>I eventually got a hold of my trembling and drooling and opened my eyes. In every direction, as far as I could see, stretched a hazy blue-ish / purple-ish plane. It also began to dawn on me that I wasn\u2019t standing or sitting on anything\u2014I was <em>floating</em>.</p>\n<p>After about a minute of wondering what the <em>hell </em>was going on in my life, a patch of the sky darkened. The dark region became smaller and more defined until it condensed into Layla floating next to me.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me again,\u201d I said.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, my thumb hit the pad a split second later than yours did. Time moves 100 times faster here than up there, so you got to spend some reflective time here by yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay where are we?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re outside your apartment building. Remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRighttt. So what <em>size</em> are we?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe went down the same jump you did when you transitioned from your world to ours\u2014we shrunk to 1/10,000<sup>th</sup> of our previous size. So you\u2019re now 18 nanometers tall. If you stood on the edge of a cross-section of a human hair, it would take you about two hours to walk across it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTime here is now going by at 100X the speed of time in my world, which means it\u2019s moving 10,000 times faster than the speed of time in yours. You could spend a year here and less than an hour would pass in your world.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKind of like Inception?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really. Anyway, nothing down here works the way it does in our worlds. Like see how the ground is all eternal and purply?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not really ground, and it\u2019s not really purple. When you\u2019re this small, there aren\u2019t any solid objects in the sense you understand. And your eyes are too small now to perceive the visible light spectrum.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what the hell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t really get it either. But the people who live here have incredibly advanced ways of manipulating the quantum field so we can feel like we\u2019re intact humans, floating in place, seeing purple. They set it up this way because it\u2019s something we can make sense of.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice of them. Where are they all anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe thing is, they don\u2019t like our world, and they <em>really </em>don\u2019t like your world. They interact with us occasionally, when it\u2019s necessary, but they\u2019ll never allow you or anyone from your world to see them or know anything about how they live. This is actually the first time anyone from your world has been allowed down here, other than Andy Kaufman, who\u2019s lived here since 1984.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why am I allowed to be here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I can show you this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Layla straightened her arm in front of her, with her palm facing outwards. Her palm lit up and when it did, a bizarre-looking giant object was revealed in front of us.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis,\u201d Layla said, \u201cis SARS-CoV-2. Down here, it\u2019s the size of a house.\u201d</p>\n<p>I looked up at the vast virus in front of me. It looked nothing like it had when it was a fuzzy grain of sand in my hand. It was transparent, like a massive, intricately structured, sphere-shaped jellyfish. There was a kind of furious movement within the transparency, but I couldn\u2019t see anything specific moving. It was confusing.</p>\n<p>Layla motioned for me to come close to the virus. She took my hand and placed my palm onto the virus\u2019s almost invisible surface. It felt kind of like palming a grape bunch except instead of grapes it was tapioca balls like the ones in those bubble teas\u2014if the tapioca balls were vibrating so vigorously that it felt a little like being mildly electroshocked, like when you put your finger in an electrical outlet. It was an unpleasant sensation, though not quite painful, and <em>super </em>weird and cool-feeling.</p>\n<p>\u201cPull one off,\u201d Layla said.</p>\n<p>It took me a few tries to latch onto one of the atoms, because they\u2019re \u201cslippery\u201d (quotes because there is no word for what it felt like, but &#8220;slippery&#8221; gets the general idea across), and when I finally got one and pulled, there was a lot of resistance. When I pulled it, it dragged the adjacent atoms along with it, and the harder I pulled, the more ferociously and unpleasantly it vibrated. Finally it <em>snapped </em>free. I looked at my fist\u2014<em>I had an atom.</em></p>\n<p>Layla smiled. \u201cCool right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>So </em>cool. Can I keep it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure good luck with that.\u201d</p>\n<p>I was so awe-struck by so many things, I had forgotten how intensely confused I was.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, so why did you <em>make</em> this?\u201d</p>\n<p>She turned towards me. \u201cAs I said, because of the way time moves\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour world has been around a lot longer than ours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. And <em>this</em> world we\u2019re in now has been around a lot longer than <em>mine</em>. They know much more about everything than we do, and they can do things we can\u2019t even begin to understand. The stuff they can do is so over our heads they can\u2019t even <em>explain </em>it to us. And <em>we\u2019re</em> that far ahead of <em>your</em> world.</p>\n<p>For a long time, as advanced as this world was, it relied on us to preserve our world for its own survival. It exists on a patch of dirt in our village. If our village were destroyed, they would be destroyed with it. But a while back, they worked out the technology for how to be <em>location independent</em>, which means they can move from wherever they are to any other place in the universe instantly.</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t have that technology yet. We tried to learn from them, but we couldn\u2019t grasp the fundamental ideas well enough to develop it ourselves. So we\u2019re stuck in our location.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn New York City?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYup. We migrated here in the 1800s when we determined it would be a good place to interface with your world, should the need ever arise. We\u2019re also not the only people in our world. There are lots of villages like ours in different parts of the Earth. Once we connected with you, the others stopped broadcasting their location. There\u2019s no reason for more than one of us to be revealed to your world.</p>\n<p>For most of time, Earth was a safe and stable home for our world. But over the last century, your world has been advancing exponentially in technology but remaining stagnant in wisdom. You\u2019re rapidly gaining tremendous powers but still behaving like short-sighted primates. The voice of wisdom is there, but it\u2019s being trampled over by political parties, religions, and nations too mired in blind conflict to lift their heads up and see the bigger picture.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny you say that Layla. I\u2019m actually writing a whole thing about\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh I know. We did our research on everyone who lives in your vicinity so we\u2019d know how to communicate with the person we brought to us if we caught someone\u2019s attention. That\u2019s why I\u2019m speaking English and speaking in the odd way you do. Your little series is cute, even if it took us forever to read\u2014but it will have limited effect. Your world is stubborn about growing up. And in the process of destroying yourselves, we believe you\u2019ll destroy us as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re trying to kill us off with a pandemic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we wanted to kill you off, you\u2019d all be dead right now. It\u2019s an option we hope we don\u2019t have to use. We were once like you and we empathize with your struggle.</p>\n<p>We created this coronavirus to fall into a certain sweet spot\u2014not damaging enough to destroy your world, but bad enough to cause a long and scary global crisis. Short of an alien attack, it is the one thing that could make all humans in your world feel like they\u2019re on the same team against a common enemy. The first and most crucial step on the road to a long-lasting species is the epiphany that you truly are a single team, alone in a dark and dangerous universe. We\u2019re hoping the virus can help push you in that direction.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel like there was a better way to do this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe probably could have thought a little harder about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah cause it\u2019s going pretty badly up there is the thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTotes. Anyway, we couldn\u2019t make the virus on our own. It\u2019s hard enough to make something that small and complex that involves atomic and subatomic construction, but we wanted the virus to be <em>precisely</em> as harmful as it is. We needed help. The tier below us is less vulnerable to your world than we are, but for reasons I\u2019m not entirely sure about, they also believe living in a multi-tiered ecosystem may be important in the future\u2014so they share our interests. They agreed to build the virus for us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you manage to get the virus into our world?\u201d I asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny. You have to imagine it from our perspective. If you\u2019re us, the world you\u2019re planning to transform is a planet with nearly an <em>AU</em> diameter, full of <em>18-kilometer tall people</em>\u2014people so tall, your world\u2019s airplanes could accidentally fly into their belly buttons. Now imagine you\u2019re standing on that planet, smaller than one of their dust mites, pinching between your fingers something the size of a grain of sand <em>on your scale</em>. You find your way onto one of these giants\u2019 football-field-size teeth, and you <em>flick </em>the grain of sand into his kilometer-wide chasm of a mouth. And <em>that\u2019s</em> supposed to change the trajectory of their future. It seems impossible.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd yet. With some very clever maneuvers, we flicked our little particle into the mouth of an unlucky giant, and it did the trick. By the way, we were dying when you blamed it on a <em>pangolin </em>of all things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe seemed guilty. I still don\u2019t understand why you brought <em>me</em> down here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t originally planning to reveal any of this backstory to your world. But after watching things unfold for the first few weeks, we don\u2019t see enough of the effect we were hoping for. Maybe if your world learns that there are other worlds out there\u2014worlds that did manage to triumph in the wisdom game\u2014it\u2019ll empower the wise voices to stand up with a bit more courage in this struggle and in even greater challenges that lie ahead. It\u2019s a long shot, but these are desperate times.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s worth a try. I\u2019ll write a post explaining what I learned from you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd tweet out the post and send it out to your email list and stuff?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEh. Fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReady to go back up to your life? Only 23 seconds have passed there since you shrunk down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Layla and I moved ourselves on top of the big metal oval.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to increase my size 10,000-fold and yours 100,000,000-fold, so you can go back home in one shot\u2026which is a good thing because transporting up is even worse than transporting down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReady?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have one more question.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many tiers are there?\u201d I asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one knows for sure. The people on this atomic-level tier tell us they know of at least one tier below them, though they won\u2019t tell us more than that. And no one seems to know about tiers above yours. Your world is thinking about that, with all your multiverse talk. We\u2019re still working on that one too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you ever figure it out, will you let me know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne thing at a time.\u201d</p>\n<p>We touched our thumbs to the metal.</p>\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you like Wait But Why, sign up for the <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/waitbutwhy/email-signup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>email list</strong></a> and we\u2019ll send you new posts right when they come out.</p>\n<p>To support Wait But Why, <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/waitbutwhy\"><strong>visit our Patreon page</strong></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">More Posts:</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As discussed, <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/02/why-bugs-ruin-everything.html\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>why bugs ruin everything</strong></span></a>.</p>\n<p>Another time <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/what-makes-you-you.html\"><strong>we transported ourselves</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>And <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/04/stick-figure-puzzle.html\"><strong>a puzzle</strong></a> for your quarantine.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2020/03/my-morning.html\">You Won&#8217;t Believe My Morning</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com\">Wait But Why</a>.</p>\n\nhttps://waitbutwhy.com/2020/03/my-morning.html/feed\n388\n8917 \n\nIt\u2019s 2020 and you\u2019re in the future\nhttps://waitbutwhy.com/2020/01/its-2020-and-youre-in-the-future.html\n\t\t\t\t\thttps://waitbutwhy.com/2020/01/its-2020-and-youre-in-the-future.html#comments\nTim Urban\nThu, 02 Jan 2020 00:17:30 +0000\nUncategorized\nfunny\nsociety\nhttps://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8726\n<p>Some people are young, just not you.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2020/01/its-2020-and-youre-in-the-future.html\">It&#8217;s 2020 and you&#8217;re in the future</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com\">Wait But Why</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s finally the 2020s. After 20 years of not being able to refer to the decade we&#8217;re in, we&#8217;re all finally free\u2014in the clear for the next 80 years until 2100, at which point I assume <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AGI</a> will have figured out what to call the two decades between 2100 and 2120. </p>\n<p>We now live in the 20s! It&#8217;s exciting. &#8220;The twenties&#8221; is super legit-sounding, and it&#8217;s so old school. The 40s are old. The 30s even more so. But nothing is older school than the Roaring 20s.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re now in charge of making this a cool decade so when people 100 years from now are thinking about how incredibly old-timey the 2020s were, it&#8217;s old-timey in a cool appealing way and not a boring shitty way.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also weird that to us, the 2020s sounds like such a rad futuristic decade\u2014and that&#8217;s how the 1920s seemed to people 100 years ago today. They were all used to the 19-teens, and suddenly they were like, &#8220;whoa cool we&#8217;re in the <em>twenties!&#8221; </em>Then they got upset thinking about how much farther along in life their 1910 self thought they&#8217;d be by 1920.</p>\n<p>In any case, it&#8217;s a perfect time for one of those &#8220;shit we&#8217;re old&#8221; posts.</p>\n<p>So here are some New Years 2020 time facts:</p>\n<p>When World War 2 started, the Civil War felt as far away to Americans as WW2 feels to us now.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8735\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1178\" height=\"175\" srcset=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-1.png 1178w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-1-600x89.png 600w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-1-768x114.png 768w, https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-1-750x111.png 750w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1178px) 100vw, 1178px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Speaking of World War 2, the world wars were pretty close together.

So for \u201cTuesday\u2019s\u201d \u201cmini\u201d post, I decided to do something about that.\nWe think of sound as something we hear\u2014something that makes noise. But in pure physics terms, sound is just a vibration going through matter.\nThe way a vibration \u201cgoes through\u201d matter is in the form of a sound wave. When you think of sound waves, you probably think of something like this:1\n\nBut that\u2019s not how sound waves work. A wave like that is called a transverse wave, where each individual particle moves up and down to create a snake situation.\nA sound wave is more like an earthworm situation:2\n\nLike an earthworm, sound moves by compressing and decompressing. This is called a longitudinal wave. A slinky can do both kinds of waves:13\n\nSound starts with a vibration of some kind creating a longitudinal wave through matter. Check this out:4\n\nThat\u2019s what sound looks like\u2014except picture an expanding ripple of spheres doing that. In this animation, the sound wave is being generated by that vibrating grey bar on the left. The bar might be your vocal chords, a guitar string, or a waterfall continually pounding down into the river below. By looking at the red dots, you can see that even though the wave moves in one direction, each individual particle only moves back and forth, mimicking the vibration of the gray bar.\nSo instead of a curvy snake wave, sound is a pressure wave, which causes each piece of the air to be at either higher-than-normal pressure or lower-than-normal pressure. So when you see a snake-like illustration of a sound wave, it\u2019s referring to the measure of pressure, not the literal path of movement of the particles:5\n\nSound waves can go through air, which is how we normally experience it. But it can also go through liquid2 or solid matter\u2014much of the jolting that happens during an earthquake is the result of a huge sound wave whizzing through the earth (in that case, the movement of the fault is serving as the gray and red bars in the animations above).\nHow about the speed of sound? Well it depends on how quickly the pressure wave can move in a given medium. A medium that\u2019s more fluid, like air, is highly compressible, so it takes longer for the wave to move, while water is far less compressible, so there\u2019s less \u201cgive\u201d to slow the wave down. It\u2019s like two people holding an outstretched slinky between them\u2014if one pushes their end toward the other person, the wave will take a little time to travel down the slinky before the other person feels it. But if the two people are holding a broomstick, when one pushes, the other feels it immediately, because the broomstick is much less compressible.6\nSo it makes sense that the speed of sound in air (768 mph / 1,234 kmph under normal conditions) is about four times slower than the speed of sound in water, which itself is about four times slower than the speed of sound through a solid like iron.\nBack to us and hearing. Ears are an evolutionary innovation that allows us to register sound waves in the air around us and process them as information\u2014without ears, most sound waves would be imperceptible to a human with only the loudest sounds registering as a felt vibration on our skin. Ears give us a magical ability to sense even slight sound waves in a way so nuanced, it can usually tell us exactly where the sound is coming from and what the meaning of it is. And it enables us to talk. The most important kind of human communication happens when our brains send information to other brains through complex patterns of air pressure waves. Have you ever stopped and thought about how incredible that is?\nI was about to move on, but sorry, I can\u2019t get over this. The next time you\u2019re talking to someone, I want you to stop and think about what\u2019s happening. Your brain has a thought. It translates that thought into a pattern of pressure waves. Then your lungs send air out of your body, but as you do that, you vibrate your vocal chords in just the right way and you move your mouth and tongue into just the right shapes that by the time the air leaves you, it\u2019s embedded with a pattern of high- and low-pressure areas. The code in that air then spreads out to all the air in the vicinity, a little bit of which ends up in your friend\u2019s ear, where it passes by their eardrum. When it does, it vibrates their eardrum in such a way as to pass on not only the code, but exactly where in the room it came from and the particular tone of voice it came with. The eardrum\u2019s vibrations are transmitted through three tiny bones and into a little sac of fluid, which then transmits the information into electrical impulses and sends them up the auditory nerve and into the brain, where the information is decoded. And all of that happens in an eighth of a second, without any effort from either of you. Talking is a miracle.\nAnyway\u2014\nThe ear can discern many qualities of a sound it hears, but two of the most fundamental are pitch and loudness.\nPitch\nPitch is all about wavelength\u2014i.e. how far apart the pressure waves are:7\n\nThe shorter the wavelength, the higher the pitch. Humans can hear frequencies as low as 20 Hz (which is a 56 ft /17 m long wave) and as high as 20,000 Hz (.7 in / 1.7 cm). As you age, you lose your ability to hear the highest pitches, so most of you probably hear nothing when you listen to the frequencies approaching 20,000 Hz (your dog will disagree). But you\u2019ll have an easier time hearing the lowest part of the range.8 The reason you can feel low sounds, like low bass notes in music, is that the wavelength is so long that it actually takes 1/20th of a second for a full wave to pass your body (hence 20 Hz).34\nLoudness\nThe loudness5 of a sound we hear is determined by the amplitude of the pressure waves. In the animation above, the high and low-pitched sounds depicted have the same loudness, because the pressure curves at the bottom of the animation are the same size vertically. Louder sounds have a larger oscillation between the low and high pressure sections of the wave\u2014i.e. loud sounds have higher high-pressure and lower low-pressure parts than quiet sounds.\nFor sounds through the air on Earth\u2019s surface, the average of the high-pressure and low-pressure parts of the wave is our normal atmospheric pressure\u2014what we call 1 \u201catmosphere\u201d of pressure. So a sound wave might have a high pressure component of 1.0001 atmospheres and a low pressure component of .9999 atmospheres, and a louder sound might be 1.01/.99 instead\u2014but in both cases, the average of the two is 1 atmosphere.\nWe often measure loudness using a unit called the decibel (named after Alexander Graham Bell). If you want to be confused, read the Wikipedia page on decibels. It\u2019s a super icky unit. And rather than bore us both by explaining it, let\u2019s just talk about how we use decibels to measure sound.\nThe scale of loudness has a very tiny minimum. The faintest sounds are far softer than any human could hear\u2014even softer than any of our finest scientific instruments could detect. But depending on where you are, sound has a hard maximum. The reason is that sound isn\u2019t a thing in itself\u2014it\u2019s a pressure wave moving through a medium. And since, as we talked about, the average of the high and low pressure points of a sound wave has to be the normal pressure of the medium, loudness is limited by the fact that eventually, the low pressure point hits zero-pressure\u2014a vacuum. Since the low pressure can\u2019t go any lower, that point determines the max amplitude of a sound wave, and the loudest a sound can be, in any given place.\nThe convenient thing about decibels (dB) is that the absolute faintest sound detectable to the human ear is, by definition, 0 dB\u2014we call that \u201cthe threshold of hearing.\u201d Scientists do their best to study sounds far down into the negative decibel scale and there are man-made rooms on Earth that register as low as -9.4 dB\u2014where it\u2019s so quiet you can hear the blood pumping through your own brain\u2014but we can only hear sounds in the dB positives. The loudest a sustained sound can possibly be on Earth\u2019s surface is 194 dB\u2014which is when the amplitude of the sound wave is so intense that the low pressure part is a perfect vacuum (the wave alternates between double the normal atmospheric pressure and no air at all\u2014not something you want to be present for). Let\u2019s take a look at the full scale, starting with the really quiet.\nOne thing to keep in mind is that with decibels, each increase of 10 dB doubles the loudness. So 20 dB is twice as loud as 10 dB, 30 dB is four times as loud as 10 dB, and 80 dB is 128 times louder than 10 dB.69\n\nThe scale stops at 194 because there\u2019s no such thing as a louder sound on Earth\u2019s surface. But we can go beyond here in two ways:\n1) Shock Waves\nWhen enough energy is released to pass the 194 dB mark, it\u2019s too much to create a sustained pressure wave because we\u2019ve bottomed out on low pressure\u2014but things still happen. Very, very intense things.\nAt 194 dB, there\u2019s a maxed out wave alternating between double the normal pressure and a total vacuum\u2014but once we get to 195 dB, the energy stops moving through the air and starts pushing the air outward with an expanding vacuum. The more dBs above 194 there are, the farther reaching and higher-impact that vacuum bubble will be. It expands outward as a rapidly-growing half-sphere:10\n\nOn the edge of the bubble is a barrier of super-compressed gas, and when this barrier sweeps over the land, it usually flattens whatever\u2019s in its path:11\n\nAs the hemisphere expands, it loses energy and eventually dissipates. But if you found yourself in the path of a shock wave before that happened, you\u2019d have a bad time. First, the impact of the super-compressed barrier would be like hitting a brick wall (in the same way and for the same reason falling on water from a bridge is like falling on concrete). Second, compressed air is hot. Third, it wouldn\u2019t just hit all parts of your body, it would go through your body, and if it were powerful enough it could turn your bones to powder and your organs to soup.\nHere are some famous 194dB+ events:\nSaturn V launch: The Saturn V was a beast, and the sound waves from its launches were so intense that they could light grass on fire a mile away. Even at three miles away, an observer would experience ear-splitting 135 dB sound.12 Rocket launches create such a powerful sound, that space agencies flood the launchpad with water as the rocket launches to absorb the sound so the force of the pressure wave doesn\u2019t damage the rocket.\nThe Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs: According to sources I read, these clocked in at well over 200 dB. The shock wave was so charged that it traveled 7 mi / 11 km in 30 seconds.\nThe 1883 Krakatoa volcano eruption:13 I\u2019m overwhelmed by the amount of things I need to tell you about the Krakatoa. Let\u2019s do bullets.\n\nKrakatoa is an island in Indonesia, and the eruption happened on August 27, 1883.\nThe eruption completely annihilated the island, sending an enormous amount of debris 17 miles (27 km) high into the sky at half a mile per second. It also caused one of the most deadly and far-reaching tsunamis in history. In total, the eruption killed 36,000 people.\nBut the most amazing thing about the eruption was its sound. It made arguably the loudest sound on Earth in modern history.\nIt was so loud that the shock wave extended far enough to rupture the eardrums of sailors 40 miles away.\n100 miles away, the sound was still 172 dB, enough to permanently destroy someone\u2019s ears or even kill them. Wherever you are, think of a place that\u2019s about 100 miles (161 km) away. Now imagine something happening there that causes a sound so loud where you are that if you were screaming at the top of your lungs directly into someone\u2019s ear when the sound hit, they wouldn\u2019t be able to hear that you were doing it. For comparison, the Saturn V launch sound was at 170 dB 100 meters away. Krakatoa was higher than that 100 miles away.\nThe sound cracked a foot-thick concrete wall 300 miles (483 km) away.\nThe sound was heard all the way in Australia (where it sounded like a distant canon ball being fired) and even as far away as Rodrigues Island, 3,000 miles away. 3,000 miles away. I\u2019m currently in New York. Imagine if something happened in California or in Europe that I could hear in New York. I can\u2019t even.\nAfter the sound eventually got far enough away that humans couldn\u2019t hear it anymore, barometers all over the world were going nuts for the next few days, as the sound waves circled the Earth 3.5 times.\nFinally, you know the famous painting The Scream? Well you know how the sky\u2019s all red for some reason? The sky is red because the painter, Edvard Munch, was inspired to paint it after seeing the Krakatoa-caused red skies all over the Western Hemisphere in the year after the eruption.\n\nIt was a big eruption.\n2) Other Mediums\nThere can be louder sound than 194 dB\u2014just not on the Earth\u2019s surface. There can be louder sounds in the ocean, in the land, or on other planets. The gas giants in our Solar System, for example, have denser atmospheres than Earth\u2019s, which allow for higher pressure wave amplitudes, and with incredibly fast winds and powerful storms, there\u2019s plenty of opportunity there to make loud things.\nWhat isn\u2019t loud is almost everything else in space. You\u2019ve probably heard the term, \u201cSound doesn\u2019t travel in a vacuum,\u201d but it makes sense now, right? Sound is pressure waves through matter. If there\u2019s no matter, there\u2019s no sound. There can be immense heat, and radiation, and force, but to a nearby observing human, it\u2019s all dead silent.\nIf, hypothetically, there were air filling the universe, then suddenly things would get very loud. Forget the terrifying concept of the sound of a supernova\u2014just the dumb sun sitting there hanging out would ring in at an astounding 290 dB. According to one solar physicist, we\u2019d hear that on Earth as a 100 dB sound\u2014the volume of a motorcycle\u2014all the time, every day, everywhere. Be happy that sound doesn\u2019t travel in a vacuum.\nOne last thought\u2014\nResearching for this post and learning about what sound is gave me a new perspective on the tree falling in the forest with nobody there to hear it question. I now think that no, it doesn\u2019t make a sound. It makes an air pressure wave and that\u2019s it. The concept of sound is by definition a biological being\u2019s perception of the pressure wave\u2014and if there are no ears around to perceive the pressure wave, there\u2019s no sound. It\u2019s a little like asking, \u201cIf humans go extinct, and somewhere in the post-apocalyptic rubble, there\u2019s a photo of a beautiful woman lying there\u2014is she still beautiful?\u201d I kind of don\u2019t think she is. Because the only thing that\u2019s beautiful about her is that humans found her beautiful, and without humans, she\u2019s no more beautiful than the female beetle a few feet away, rummaging around the rubble.

For information on the previous deprecation of Google+ for users with personal Google accounts, please see this post.\u00a0What's ChangingLast year, we announced plans to wind down Currents, to focus efforts on community experiences that are better integrated with the rest of Google Workspace. To help our customers manage this transition, we published detailed guidance for Workspace administrators and enabled customers to opt-in for automated migration of Currents data to spaces in Google Chat.\u00a0We are nearing the end of this transition. Beginning July 5, 2023, Currents will no longer be available. Workspace administrators can export Currents data using Takeout before August 8, 2023. Beginning August 8th, Currents data will no longer be available for download.\u00a0Although we are saying goodbye to Currents, we continue to invest in new features for Google Chat, so teams can connect and collaborate with a shared sense of belonging. Over the last year, we've delivered features designed to support community engagement at scale, and will continue to deliver more. Here is a summary of the features with additional details below:\u00a0This month, we\u2019re enabling new ways for organizations to share information across the enterprise with announcements in Google Chat. This gives admin controls to limit permissions for posting in a space, while enabling all members to read and react, helping ensure that important updates stay visible and relevant. Later this year, we plan to simplify membership management by integrating Google Groups with spaces in Chat, enable post-level metrics for announcements, and provide tools for Workspace administrators to manage spaces across their domain.\u00a0Announcements in Google ChatManaging space membership with Google GroupsWe\u2019ve already rolled out new ways to make conversations more expressive and engaging such as in-line threading to enable rich exploration of a specific topic without overtaking the main conversation and custom emojis to enable fun, personal expression.In-line threaded conversationsDiscover and join communities with up to 8,000 membersWe\u2019ve also made it easier for individuals to discover and join communities of shared interest. By searching in Gmail, users can explore a directory of available spaces covering topics of personal or professional interest such as gardening, pets, career development, fitness, cultural identity, and more, with the ability to invite others to join via link. Last year, we increased the size of communities supported by spaces in Chat to 8,000 members, and we are working to scale this in a meaningful way later this year.\u00a0A directory of spaces in Google Chat for users to join.As communities grow, it\u2019s essential to provide tools for content moderation and data management. Last year, we introduced space managers, a community lead with abilities to moderate conversation and manage membership, and last year at NEXT, we rolled out data loss prevention (DLP) for Chat. We will continue to enhance community health and data security for Google Chat.\u00a0Our partner community is extending the power of Chat through integrations with essential third-party apps such as Jira, GitHub, Asana, PagerDuty, Zendesk and Salesforce. Many organizations have built custom workflow apps using low-code and no-code tools, and we anticipate that this number will continue to grow with the GA releases of the Chat API and AppSheet\u2019s Chat app building capabilities later this year.For teams to thrive in this rapidly changing era of hybrid work, it\u2019s essential to build authentic personal connections and a strong sense of belonging, no matter when or where individuals work. We will continue to make Google Chat the best option for Workspace customers seeking to build a community and culture for hybrid teams, with much more to come later this year.\u00a0Who's impactedAdmins and end usersWhy it\u2019s importantThe transition from Currents to spaces in Google Chat removes a separate, siloed destination and provides organizations with a modern, enterprise-grade experience that reflects how the world is working today. Google Workspace customers use Google Chat to communicate about projects, share organizational updates, and build community. \nRecommended action Admins: Review the Change Management Guide. Use Takeout to explore your organization\u2019s Currents data before August 8, 2023.

We dusted off The List, picked a country that\u2019s been at the very top for years, tossed the kids to the grandparents for a week, and headed off to Bhutan.1\nBhutan, if you\u2019re not familiar, is a tiny 800,000-person country squashed between two behemoths.\n\n\n\n\n\nBhutan was unified in the 17th century after millennia of existing as a collection of warring tribes. In the time since then, it has somehow avoided being annexed by China or India. Today, it is the world\u2019s last Buddhist kingdom, and I can confirm that it is both very Buddhist and very kingdom-y. Temples are everywhere, and the people are highly superstitious\u2014our tour guide seemed to constantly be remarking about good luck and bad luck, promising omens and inauspicious riverbends. (The temples are beautiful, but so are all the other buildings. All architecture in the country, from the airport to the shopping centers, has a uniform Bhutanese style.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe king is universally beloved and, at least the way they tell it, an exemplary ruler. A typical story we heard: 50,000 people work in the country\u2019s tourist industry, all of whom were suddenly out of work during Covid. So the king gave these families $120/month, enough to get by on until the industry came back. He paid this out of his own pocket, nearly to the point of personal bankruptcy.\n\n\n\n(Of course, I was also told in North Korea that it was only by the grace and courage of their magnanimous leaders that the people were prosperous and free, unlike their unfortunate South Korean cousins suffering under American occupation. But the situations are wildly different and I am inclined to mostly believe what I heard in Bhutan.)\n\n\nOne more story to illustrate what a sweetie Bhutan is: The country has a strict policy against killing animals and never euthanizes stray dogs, so there are a lot of them. They mostly live off the detritus of restaurants and hotels. When everything shut down during Covid, the king told people to bring cooked food out to the dogs and even wrap them in blankets during the cold months.\n\nBhutan does things differently than other countries. Hellbent on preserving their traditional way of life, TV and internet were banned in the country until 1999, and if it weren\u2019t for the cars, I might have been convinced I had taken a time machine back to the 1600s. Tourism is limited, only possible in the form of a guided tour, and immigrating to the country is near impossible. They are so diligent about conservation that Bhutan is the world\u2019s one carbon-negative country\u2014their vast forests absorb more CO2 than their populace emits.\nIn 1972, Bhutan\u2019s king decided that Gross National Happiness was a more important metric than Gross Domestic Product, and their policies cater to this value.2 It\u2019s why Bhutan is famous for supposedly being the world\u2019s happiest country, which I had no way to verify, but the people were very kind and seemed pretty happy I guess?\n\nSadly, Bhutan\u2019s way of life is threatened now as many of its young people have left to find opportunity elsewhere. The king is attempting to fix this with plans to construct Gelephu Mindfulness City, an economic hub which will center around innovation, while preserving Bhutanese tradition. It looks like it\u2019ll be incredible, though I was told not to hold my breath as it will probably not be finished for 20 more years.\nAll of this is to say that Bhutan is a special place\u2014remote, mysterious, and breathtakingly beautiful. Which is why it was always prominently on The List.\nA trip to Bhutan is better shown than told, so I kept most of the details to this video:\n\n_______\nMore posts from The List:SiberiaTokyoNigeriaIraqGreenlandNorth KoreaAnd The genie question\n_______\n\nIf you like Wait But Why, sign up for our email list and we\u2019ll send you new posts when they come out.\nTo support Wait But Why, visit our Patreon page.

Happiness too.\u201d Everyone appears to have ignored them.\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAbout Tim Urban\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tView all posts

For information on the previous deprecation of Google+ for users with personal Google accounts, please see this post.\u00a0What's ChangingLast year, we announced plans to wind down Currents, to focus efforts on community experiences that are better integrated with the rest of Google Workspace. To help our customers manage this transition, we published detailed guidance for Workspace administrators and enabled customers to opt-in for automated migration of Currents data to spaces in Google Chat.\u00a0We are nearing the end of this transition. Beginning July 5, 2023, Currents will no longer be available. Workspace administrators can export Currents data using Takeout before August 8, 2023. Beginning August 8th, Currents data will no longer be available for download.\u00a0Although we are saying goodbye to Currents, we continue to invest in new features for Google Chat, so teams can connect and collaborate with a shared sense of belonging. Over the last year, we've delivered features designed to support community engagement at scale, and will continue to deliver more. Here is a summary of the features with additional details below:\u00a0This month, we\u2019re enabling new ways for organizations to share information across the enterprise with announcements in Google Chat. This gives admin controls to limit permissions for posting in a space, while enabling all members to read and react, helping ensure that important updates stay visible and relevant. Later this year, we plan to simplify membership management by integrating Google Groups with spaces in Chat, enable post-level metrics for announcements, and provide tools for Workspace administrators to manage spaces across their domain.\u00a0Announcements in Google ChatManaging space membership with Google GroupsWe\u2019ve already rolled out new ways to make conversations more expressive and engaging such as in-line threading to enable rich exploration of a specific topic without overtaking the main conversation and custom emojis to enable fun, personal expression.In-line threaded conversationsDiscover and join communities with up to 8,000 membersWe\u2019ve also made it easier for individuals to discover and join communities of shared interest. By searching in Gmail, users can explore a directory of available spaces covering topics of personal or professional interest such as gardening, pets, career development, fitness, cultural identity, and more, with the ability to invite others to join via link. Last year, we increased the size of communities supported by spaces in Chat to 8,000 members, and we are working to scale this in a meaningful way later this year.\u00a0A directory of spaces in Google Chat for users to join.As communities grow, it\u2019s essential to provide tools for content moderation and data management. Last year, we introduced space managers, a community lead with abilities to moderate conversation and manage membership, and last year at NEXT, we rolled out data loss prevention (DLP) for Chat. We will continue to enhance community health and data security for Google Chat.\u00a0Our partner community is extending the power of Chat through integrations with essential third-party apps such as Jira, GitHub, Asana, PagerDuty, Zendesk and Salesforce. Many organizations have built custom workflow apps using low-code and no-code tools, and we anticipate that this number will continue to grow with the GA releases of the Chat API and AppSheet\u2019s Chat app building capabilities later this year.For teams to thrive in this rapidly changing era of hybrid work, it\u2019s essential to build authentic personal connections and a strong sense of belonging, no matter when or where individuals work. We will continue to make Google Chat the best option for Workspace customers seeking to build a community and culture for hybrid teams, with much more to come later this year.\u00a0Who's impactedAdmins and end usersWhy it\u2019s importantThe transition from Currents to spaces in Google Chat removes a separate, siloed destination and provides organizations with a modern, enterprise-grade experience that reflects how the world is working today. Google Workspace customers use Google Chat to communicate about projects, share organizational updates, and build community. \nRecommended action Admins: Review the Change Management Guide. Use Takeout to explore your organization\u2019s Currents data before August 8, 2023.

Just like that, I was back here:\n\n\n\n\n\nOn one hand, now time doesn\u2019t exist at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the second child is\u2026easier than the first.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I\u2019m not here to talk about the new baby, delightful and obese as she may be. Today, I report to you from the depths of toddler parenthood. I always thought two-year-olds were basically unconscious blobs with a cold, but it turns out they\u2019re actual people you can get to know. Having now spent some time cohabitating with one, I\u2019ve made the following discoveries:\n1) You can be simultaneously completely obsessed with and dramatically bored by the same person.\nSometimes when I\u2019m working in my office, my daughter will toddle in, run over to me, and give me a hug. It is by far the best part of my day. Her smile fills me with utter joy. Her little voice is sent straight from heaven. I feel the purest possible love for her.\nIt\u2019s just that I also find her groundbreakingly boring. A five-minute hangout is one thing, but when I\u2019m deep in an afternoon with her, it\u2019s hard to come to any other conclusion than that I\u2019ve spent my last three hours with a person whose IQ is 20.\n\n\n\n\n\n2) Toddlers are dicks.\nIt\u2019s well-known that toddlers transform into mid-20th-century totalitarian dictators at the drop of a hat.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut they\u2019re dicks in less obvious ways too. The other day, my toddler was playing with Legos. I sat down next to her and asked her what she was building, and she said, \u201cDaddy needs to work in his office?\u201d\u2014an unsubtle hint that I should leave her the fuck alone.\nOr the times I cook a whole thing for her with care and love and she refuses to take a bite, making me feel cluey for myself.\nMost recently, I made the mistake of telling her my age, and now she says \u201cDaddy is 43\u201d like 30 times a day, constantly filling me with existential dread.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3) No one wants to see videos of someone else\u2019s toddler.\nToddler parenthood is a reality distortion zone that makes it hard to remember that most people find your toddler breathtakingly uninteresting.1\n\n\n\n\n\nFriends who have kids the same age as yours are kind of in a cohort together, so parents of toddlers often end up with a whole throng of toddlers in their lives. Amongst my cohort I\u2019ve both been an offender and frequent victim of toddler-video-showing. It\u2019s part of the tax we all pay.2\nI try to at least minimize the fallout from my end.\n\n\n\n\n\n4) Someone else\u2019s toddler can ruin your week.\n\n\n\n\n\n5) Toddlers are geniuses who are also very dumb.\nIf I took my daughter to China for a year, and we just lived there with no language instruction, I\u2019d come back knowing approximately six Mandarin words and she\u2019d be fluent. It makes no sense to me that toddlers just learn a language by hearing the language, but somehow they do. They\u2019re weird freak geniuses. But then she says stuff like \u201cwould you like a strawberry?\u201d when she wants a strawberry, because when we say \u201cyou,\u201d it refers to her, so she now thinks \u201cyou\u201d is a synonym for her name, which is very unimpressive.\nLikewise, the other day I read her a new book for the first time, and then the second time I read it to her, she stopped me in the middle to correct something I said. It turns out I had accidentally skipped a word, which she knew because she somehow memorized the whole book on the first read. But then we\u2019ll pick up another book and she\u2019ll stare at the page for a million years looking for where Curious George is \u201chiding\u201d even though he\u2019s obviously right the fuck there.\n6) Toddlers have a highly inaccurate worldview.\nWe sometimes take our toddler to story time at the library, where the librarian reads a book to a bunch of kids. The first time we took her, she decided to take matters into her own hands and, mid-story, went and sat in the librarian\u2019s lap. The issue is that she hadn\u2019t quite figured out that the world does not exist entirely for her benefit.\nIt\u2019s understandable. You\u2019re born into the world and for the first few years, everyone you see smiles and waves at you, so you overestimate your importance. Only slowly do you learn what\u2019s really happening.3\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is part of the broader phenomenon of a toddler not really having any idea what\u2019s going on. They don\u2019t know about death, or money, or history, or sex, or the Big Bang, or basically anything about reality. They just emerged out of nowhere and started being, which for some reason doesn\u2019t strike them as weird or confusing.\n(A good \u201cdo you have any idea what\u2019s going on?\u201d litmus test is: If you\u2019re walking down the street and an elephant flies down from the sky, hovers ten feet above you and says hello in a silly cartoon voice before flying off, would you be like \u201cOH MY GOD WHAT JUST HAPPENED\u201d or would you shrug and be like \u201cI guess that\u2019s something that happens\u201d? If the latter, you have no idea what\u2019s going on. Most two-year-olds fail this test.)\n7) Toddlers are both the funniest and least funny possible people.\nMy daughter is remarkably unfunny. Once when she dropped something, I said \u201ckerplunk,\u201d and she found it fucking hilarious. For the next ten minutes, she kept picking things up, dropping them, and saying \u201ckerplunk,\u201d hysterically laughing each time.\nBut unintentionally, she\u2019s a comedic genius. When I was in her way recently, she said, \u201cCan you get out of space?\u201d which my wife and I now say to each other whenever we want the other to move. Another time, we had to rip a band-aid off her leg, after which she said, \u201cI am so perfectly sad,\u201d and now my wife and I say that anytime we\u2019re unhappy about something.4\nWe\u2019ve also discovered an amazing hack: you can just teach a toddler to say whatever you want. We taught her to say \u201cmamma mia\u201d whenever she falls over, which I highly recommend to other toddler parents.\n8) Toddler parents have very strong opinions and everyone is very judgy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem is, for every strong opinion, there\u2019s an equally strong opposite opinion.\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve taken to accepting that I\u2019m messing up all kinds of things, and mainly just try to have fun with my little friend. To the extent that I have a strategy, it\u2019s basically:\n\nSpend lots of (phone-free) time with her\nShow her that the world is a fun and fascinating place\nEncourage her to reason from first principles\nDon\u2019t interrupt her when she\u2019s focused or daydreaming; help her learn to be entertained by her own mind\nRefrain from imposing lots of little rules, but where there are rules, be firm about them\nBuild problem-solving confidence, teaching her to become a person who says \u201cI want to figure out the directions\u201d instead of a person who says \u201clet\u2019s just ask someone\u201d\n\nToddler parents can take solace in the fact that parenting probably matters less than we think it does. Rather than try to shape our little two-foot-tall companions, we should help guide them to become the best version of who they already are.\nAnyway, gotta go. Time to read Squeak the Mouse Likes His House for the 57th time.\n___________\nMore tales from fatherhood: 10 Thoughts from the Fourth Trimester\nMy favorite toddler books: Flotsam, Little Fur Family, The Giant Jam Sandwich, Little Owl\u2019s Night\nIf you\u2019d rather read about something other than my fat babies:\nThe Marriage Decision: Everything Forever or Nothing Ever Again\nTaming the Mammoth: Why You Should Stop Caring What Other People Think\nWhy I\u2019m Always Late\n_______\n\nIf you like Wait But Why, sign up for our email list and we\u2019ll send you new posts when they come out.\nTo support Wait But Why, visit our Patreon page.\nToddler grandparents may be an exception, though they span a wide range, from \u201cPlease go away for a month and leave them with me\u201d on one end, to \u201cI will play with them for five minutes but only because it looks bad if I don\u2019t\u201d on the other. Those on the latter end are as bored by toddler videos as everyone else.\u21a9There\u2019s a range here. A short, high-quality video of a good friend\u2019s toddler, sent by text (so you can watch on your own time and don\u2019t have to react the whole time) is fine\u2014nice even. A person you barely know showing you a long toddler video, in person, is a nightmare.\u21a9Some have suggested that the common desire for fame is, in some subconscious sense, an attempt to recapture the long-lost feeling that the whole world knows and loves you.\u21a9She actually said \u201cCan I get out of space?\u201d and \u201cYou are so perfectly sad\u201d because, again, she is confused about pronouns.\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAbout Tim Urban\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tView all posts by Tim Urban \u2192 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious

For information on the previous deprecation of Google+ for users with personal Google accounts, please see this post.\u00a0What's ChangingLast year, we announced plans to wind down Currents, to focus efforts on community experiences that are better integrated with the rest of Google Workspace. To help our customers manage this transition, we published detailed guidance for Workspace administrators and enabled customers to opt-in for automated migration of Currents data to spaces in Google Chat.\u00a0We are nearing the end of this transition. Beginning July 5, 2023, Currents will no longer be available. Workspace administrators can export Currents data using Takeout before August 8, 2023. Beginning August 8th, Currents data will no longer be available for download.\u00a0Although we are saying goodbye to Currents, we continue to invest in new features for Google Chat, so teams can connect and collaborate with a shared sense of belonging. Over the last year, we've delivered features designed to support community engagement at scale, and will continue to deliver more. Here is a summary of the features with additional details below:\u00a0This month, we\u2019re enabling new ways for organizations to share information across the enterprise with announcements in Google Chat. This gives admin controls to limit permissions for posting in a space, while enabling all members to read and react, helping ensure that important updates stay visible and relevant. Later this year, we plan to simplify membership management by integrating Google Groups with spaces in Chat, enable post-level metrics for announcements, and provide tools for Workspace administrators to manage spaces across their domain.\u00a0Announcements in Google ChatManaging space membership with Google GroupsWe\u2019ve already rolled out new ways to make conversations more expressive and engaging such as in-line threading to enable rich exploration of a specific topic without overtaking the main conversation and custom emojis to enable fun, personal expression.In-line threaded conversationsDiscover and join communities with up to 8,000 membersWe\u2019ve also made it easier for individuals to discover and join communities of shared interest. By searching in Gmail, users can explore a directory of available spaces covering topics of personal or professional interest such as gardening, pets, career development, fitness, cultural identity, and more, with the ability to invite others to join via link. Last year, we increased the size of communities supported by spaces in Chat to 8,000 members, and we are working to scale this in a meaningful way later this year.\u00a0A directory of spaces in Google Chat for users to join.As communities grow, it\u2019s essential to provide tools for content moderation and data management. Last year, we introduced space managers, a community lead with abilities to moderate conversation and manage membership, and last year at NEXT, we rolled out data loss prevention (DLP) for Chat. We will continue to enhance community health and data security for Google Chat.\u00a0Our partner community is extending the power of Chat through integrations with essential third-party apps such as Jira, GitHub, Asana, PagerDuty, Zendesk and Salesforce. Many organizations have built custom workflow apps using low-code and no-code tools, and we anticipate that this number will continue to grow with the GA releases of the Chat API and AppSheet\u2019s Chat app building capabilities later this year.For teams to thrive in this rapidly changing era of hybrid work, it\u2019s essential to build authentic personal connections and a strong sense of belonging, no matter when or where individuals work. We will continue to make Google Chat the best option for Workspace customers seeking to build a community and culture for hybrid teams, with much more to come later this year.\u00a0Who's impactedAdmins and end usersWhy it\u2019s importantThe transition from Currents to spaces in Google Chat removes a separate, siloed destination and provides organizations with a modern, enterprise-grade experience that reflects how the world is working today. Google Workspace customers use Google Chat to communicate about projects, share organizational updates, and build community. \nRecommended action Admins: Review the Change Management Guide. Use Takeout to explore your organization\u2019s Currents data before August 8, 2023.

In the last week, life has gotten weird.\n\n\n  My journey to the Haleakal\u0101 shield volcano Austin coffee shop began more than 30 years ago, in 1990, when my parents brought me to something called a \u201cvirtual reality exhibit\u201d at the Seaport World Trade Center in Boston. I stood on a little circular pedestal, and the guy handed me a plastic gun and put a big headset on me. Suddenly I was in some cartoon world, in a military uniform, holding a real gun. The person on the pedestal next to me was there, also a cartoon, also holding a gun. After some janky waving and shooting, they kicked me out for the next person in line. \n\n\n  I had recently read The Phantom Tollbooth, where a kid in the real world crosses a magic threshold and enters a cartoon world. This felt like that. I wanted more.\n\n\n  Then VR disappeared for 25 years. Throughout the \u201890s and 2000s, \u201cvirtual reality\u201d was a forgotten dream\u2014a cool concept that never made it. But in the mid-2010s, VR made an unexpected comeback. 20-year-old Palmer Luckey\u2019s duct-taped headset prototype had impressed enough investors for Oculus to become a real company. In 2014, Facebook bought Oculus. Google and Sony got involved. It was all finally happening.\n\n   In 2016, I decided to write about the VR revolution. I went around Silicon Valley, interviewing people at Google and Facebook to get the full scoop on VR. I even sat down with Mark Zuckerberg.\n\n\n  I demoed everything. It was mind-blowing. VR was about to take over the world. And I was gonna be the one to tell everyone.\n\n\n  Then two things happened:\n\n\n\n  VR didn\u2019t take over the world.\n\n   I didn\u2019t write a VR post because I fell into a six-year book hole instead. \n\n   From the bottom of my book hole, I kept following the story. At Facebook\u2019s 2016 developer conference, Zuckerberg had demoed a new bleeding-edge kind of \u201cstandalone, inside out\u201d headset. Up until then, there were two ways to do VR: The first was with a cheap headset, maybe using your phone as a screen, that could do primitive head-movement tracking but had no way to see the environment around you. The second was with external sensors on the walls and a headset that attached to a high-powered PC with a cord. \u201cStandalone\u201d meant the new headset would have the computer inside, with no need for a cable. \u201cInside out\u201d meant the headset could see the room around you, so you didn\u2019t need external sensors. In 2016, this was just a prototype. Three years later, Facebook launched Oculus Quest.  \n   In 2020, standing around during Covid with my dick in my hand like everyone else, I got myself a Quest 2. It was amazing. I loved it. It was my daily post-writing reward activity. I made 3D art. I swam with whales. I went on cartoon vacations. I exercised by slashing music. I beat Trover. \n   Then, for some reason, I stopped. I can\u2019t really explain why. I really loved being in the Quest 2. I recently dusted it off to give friends a demo and they were floored, reminding me how great it is. It just didn\u2019t hook me. Maybe it was the solo aspect. I don\u2019t have friends who do VR so there\u2019s no one else to play with. Maybe it\u2019s the friction. It\u2019s minor, but charging the headset, putting it on, and creating a boundary1 is still a lot more friction than picking up my phone. Maybe my delight relied more on novelty than I realized. \n   It\u2019s not just me. VR blows everyone away when they try it, but it seems to have a hard time hooking people for the long run. After a major wave of hype in the mid-2010s, VR receded into the land of subcultures. \n\n  And the question is: Is there some fatal flaw to the concept of VR that will always prevent it from achieving mass adoption? Or are we some tipping point away from VR exploding into the stratosphere like the computer and smartphone?\n\nEnter Apple\n\n   Everyone remembers where they were when they learned that JFK was shot, a man had landed on the moon, or airplanes had flown into the Twin Towers. I remember where I was when I saw Steve Jobs unveil the first iPhone. \n\n  I didn\u2019t always like Apple. My family\u2019s first computer was an Apple 2GS. But then, like many early Apple computer users, I became a PC person. I used an IBM ThinkPad in college and thought Apple people were annoying.\n\n\n  Then Steve Jobs came back to Apple and started Making Apple Great Again. My post-college music composing path forced me to get a 2004 PowerBook G4. After getting used to the interface (why the fuck is there no start button?), I realized that Macs were amazing, and I\u2019ve been an annoying Apple person ever since. But it wasn\u2019t until 2007 that I became a fanboy.\n\n   In the presentation, when Jobs did the world\u2019s first \u201cswipe to unlock,\u201d the audience made an audible gasp. A minute later, he brought up a list of artists in the phone\u2019s \u201ciPod\u201d app and asked, \u201cWell, how do I scroll through my list of artists? I just take my finger and scroll.\u201d Another audible gasp. It\u2019s weird that something so normal today was jaw-dropping 17 years ago. \n   The feeling I had watching that presentation had happened before. I felt it when I was five years old and tried Nintendo for the first time at a friend\u2019s house (I can make something on the TV move by clicking this button??). I felt it in the early \u201890s when my friend showed me how to send an email (You can type something on your computer, hit a button, and it shows up on mine??). I felt it the first time I test-drove a Tesla (Why is this car accelerating so futuristically?).\n\n  I\u2019ve learned to see a lot of meaning in these holy shit moments. In most cases, they\u2019ve been followed by an entirely new industry sweeping the world\u2014like the smartphone, video game, internet, and electric car revolutions.\n\n   In June 2023, Apple announced the VR\u2014sorry, spatial computing\u2014headset that had been long rumored: the Vision Pro.  \n\n  I watched the presentation, but it wasn\u2019t quite like my experience in 2007. First, I had gotten excited about VR multiple times in the past and ended up disappointed. Second, unlike demoing an iPhone, watching a VR demo on a 2D screen just doesn\u2019t show you what it\u2019s actually like. Oh, also, it was $3,500. I happily shelled out $600 for the first iPhone. But $3,500? For a V1 product that will get way better (and cheaper) in the next few years? When I already have a Meta Quest? Nah. I might be a fanboy but I\u2019m not a chump. It was the obvious grown-up decision to wait it out. Then I ordered one in the first minute after preorders started.\n\n\n  This Monday morning, I went to the Apple Store to put the Vision Pro on my chump face for the first time. The staff member guided me through a demo. And there it was: the holy shit moment.\n\n\n  But it was a holy shit moment with an asterisk. I had experienced full holy shit moments both in 1990 and in 2016 with VR, and these were the notable exceptions to the \u201choly shit moments are a surefire omen of an industry about to blow up\u201d rule. Was this time different or would history repeat itself?\n\n\n  What I did know was that it was finally time to write a VR post. I wanted to post this week while everyone was hyped up about the Vision Pro. But I didn\u2019t want to write about it before I had used it a lot, so I could experience not only the honeymoon phase but also what it was like to get thoroughly sick of it.\n\n\n  The plan was clear. I went home, told my wife that I would be deeply ignoring her and our baby for the week, and spent twelve hours a day in the headset for four straight days. I\u2019m writing this on Thursday afternoon, having already logged over forty hours. Here are my thoughts.\n\nVision Pro, V1\n\n\n  There are three elements of any VR system: hardware, operating system, and applications. Let\u2019s talk about each.\n\nHardware\n\n   Apple Vision Pro (AVP)1 is heavy\u2014a decent amount heavier (650 grams) than Meta\u2019s Quest 3 (515 grams). It comes with a fancy band that goes on easily and you tighten with a little knob. It\u2019s awesome. For 12 minutes. Then it started killing my face. With 3,500 regrets, I switched to the other band it comes with, which includes a loop that goes over the top of your head, and thank god for that because it was way better\u2014so good that I am shocked to say that even at the end of a full day wearing it, I didn\u2019t feel a euphoric \u201cahhh\u201d relief taking it off. At least right now, it seems only a little more uncomfortable than wearing over-ear headphones for long periods of time. This might not apply to everyone, but I have not felt nauseous once while wearing it. \n\n  That doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s nothing that sucks about wearing it. The \u201cfield of view\u201d isn\u2019t great, meaning there are thick black walls where your peripheral vision is supposed to be, which is a bummer. I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s great for your eyes. And there\u2019s no way around the fact that you feel like an asshole when other people are in the room. \n\n\n  There\u2019s an external battery pack that connects to the headset with a cord and typically lives in my pocket. The battery lasts about three hours, but you can plug in the battery to make it last forever, like a computer if the battery only lasted for three hours. (You\u2019re often using it in conjunction with your computer, which makes it a non-issue because you can plug the battery into the computer.)\n\n   When you put the headset on, it does the AVP version of Face ID: scanning your irises. This is seamless and very futuristic. Then, you see exactly what you saw before putting the headset on. Lots of reviewers have marveled over AVP\u2019s \u201cpass-through\u201d capabilities, and the second I put it on, I understood why. While it\u2019s not perfect, it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re wearing a transparent snorkeling mask. The headset is in fact opaque\u2014cameras on the outside transmit the world onto screens on the inside. But the screens are so good and the latency so low that it really seems transparent. Then there\u2019s the much less successful attempt to make it look transparent from the outside as well, using cameras on the inside to broadcast your eyes onto the front of the headset. The goal is that if you\u2019re talking to someone while wearing the headset, it feels to both people like you\u2019re wearing a transparent snorkeling mask. But at least in V1, the eyes don\u2019t show up nearly as well as advertised. \n   The internal screens save energy by doing something clever called \u201cfoveated rendering\u201d\u2014i.e. only putting the exact place you\u2019re looking in perfect focus while making the rest of the view lower-res. This is what your actual eyes do, which is why your peripheral vision is blurry. If you watch this viewcast I made, you\u2019ll see that most of it is blurry (the sharp part was where I happened to be looking while taking it)\u2014but as the person in the headset, I only ever saw perfect sharpness. \n   The way Vision Pro does audio is also cool. There have always been two sound options for me while on my phone or computer: play from the speaker and everyone can hear it or put on headphones and no one can hear it. AVP speakers are somewhere in between. The speakers (which sound great) are small and right above your ears, and while people right next to you can hear what you\u2019re hearing, people in the next room cannot. So in a coffee shop or on an airplane, you still need headphones, but I do a lot of my work in an office in our house with the door open, and it\u2019s been nice to work both without headphones and without bothering anyone in the other room. \nOperating System\n\n\n  This was the biggest holy shit of my holy shit moment. Apple is the king of simple intuitive interfaces. Part of what drew those gasps in 2007 was how natural the iPhone\u2019s interface was. You scrolled down by pushing the page up, just like you would in real life. You zoomed by pinching with two fingers. It seemed like magic. AVP\u2019s interface is gaspworthy for the same reason. The main gesture is what I\u2019ve been calling the \u201ceye pinch.\u201d\n\n   When you press the button at the top of the headset, your apps come up, floating in the room in front of you, looking as real as any other object in the room. They\u2019re fixed in space. You can walk right up to them, and the detail is amazing.2\n\n   Vision Pro\u2019s eye tracking is outrageously good. It knows precisely where you\u2019re looking. So all you do to select an app is look at it and tap your thumb and index finger together. Your hand doesn\u2019t need to move up to do this, just somewhere the headset can see it. Watching the ads, it seemed like this might be annoying to do, but it\u2019s every bit as easy and intuitive as opening an app on a smartphone.  \n   No matter what you\u2019re doing, the eye pinch is the equivalent of touching a finger to a smartphone screen. To scroll, look anywhere in the window, pinch, and move your hand up. To move a window, look at the little bar below the window, pinch, and move it where you want to. To resize the window, look at the window\u2019s corner, pinch, and resize. \n   As John Gruber put it in his review: \nThe fundamental interaction model in VisionOS feels like it will be copied by all future VR/AR headsets, in the same way that all desktop computers work like the Mac, and all phones and tablets now work like the iPhone. And when that happens, some will argue that of course they all work that way, because how else could they work? But personal computers didn\u2019t have point-and-click GUIs before the Mac, and phones didn\u2019t have \u201cit\u2019s all just a big touchscreen\u201d interfaces before the iPhone. No other headset today has a \u201cjust look at a target, and tap your finger and thumb\u201d interface today. I suspect in a few years they all will.\n\n   Then there\u2019s the fact that everything you see in front of you is available desktop to work with. On my computer, I\u2019m used to my applications being stacked, and I toggle between them. Or maybe I put a few vertical windows side by side. In AVP, I can put one eight-foot window in front of me, two more on either side of it, and a couple more above them in the sky. Then, if I get up to go to the other room, the windows all stay exactly where they are, waiting for me to come back. If I want to switch work spots, I just hold the headset button and the whole configuration jumps to the new location. This is all way cooler than I\u2019m making it sound, so I made a video to show you how it works:\n\n\n\n   One thing you\u2019ll notice in the video is that I routinely spin the digital crown on the headset to slide between being entirely in reality, partially in reality, and entirely in a virtual landscape. This is ridiculously fun to do. And it\u2019s a general reminder that AR and VR2 being separate categories is a thing of the past. In the Vision Pro, the Quest 3, and any future headset, you can be 100% in the real world (when there\u2019s nothing on the screen and it seems like you\u2019re wearing a snorkeling mask), you can be mostly in the real world except there\u2019s a virtual game board on your kitchen table or a little virtual butterfly fluttering around. You can be halfway between reality and virtual when, say, portals open up in the walls around you during a game. Or you can go full virtual. \nApps\n\n\n  There are many categories of spatial computing apps\u2014productivity, entertainment, social, gaming, creative, fitness\u2014and for most of them today, you\u2019ll need a Meta Quest or some other non-Apple headset. There are a small handful of astounding apps for AVP, but they\u2019re more a sampling of what\u2019s possible than an actual app store.\n\n\n  The most \u201cyou can absolutely not do this anywhere but a VR headset\u201d thing I did was their little taster menu of immersive entertainment. Entertainment on a headset runs on a spectrum of immersion. The least immersive is watching a normal movie on a massive screen in a virtual space like the moon or a giant theater. Those movies you missed that everyone says are best seen on the big screen\u2014you can see those on a big screen now. \n\n\n  Next are movies that are framed in a normal rectangle, but they\u2019re 3D looking\u2014like when we used to wear those stupid paper glasses but much, much better. Sometimes, these surprise you when something comes out of the screen to fly through the air or stand on the floor between you and the screen. The AVR comes with one of these\u2014\u201cEncounter Dinosaurs\u201d\u2014and it\u2019s delightful. \n\n\n  Finally, there\u2019s full immersion, where the scene entirely surrounds you and you actually feel like you\u2019re there. These are better described as \u201cexperiences\u201d than \u201centertainment.\u201d I saw rhinos up close in person last year. Then, this week, I did one of the Vision Pro experiences that\u2019s an up-close hang with rhinos. These two experiences were very similar. Another experience lets you sit in on an Alicia Keys rehearsal where she sings some songs standing two feet away from you. You can watch her for a while, then look over at what the drummer or keyboardist is doing for a while\u2014just like you would if you were actually there.\n\n\n  Photos and videos are also cool. When you take a panoramic photo, you sweep your phone around in a C-shaped arc\u2014but on a flat phone screen, the result is a flat photo. In AVP, panos are C-shaped, like the photo you actually took. The C wraps around you, which I quickly learned brings the memory back way better than the flat version. You can also turn the headset into a camera and record photos and videos, both of which are immersive. When you later view them in the headset, they\u2019re 3D, putting you right back into the actual scene.\n\n\n  Then there\u2019s the infamous Vision Pro avatars. You get one of these by flipping the headset around and letting it take pictures of you from different angles. Then when you FaceTime someone, your avatar mimics whatever facial expressions you\u2019re making. Here\u2019s mine:\n\n\n\n  The first person I tested it out on was my wife, who immediately gasped in horror, saying I had \u201clittle uncanny valley snake eyes rolling around in my skull,\u201d whatever the fuck that means.\n\n   The uncanny valley she\u2019s upset about is this:3\n\n\n  The idea is that we like faces that are somewhat humanlike, and we like faces that are totally humanlike, but we hate faces that are almost-but-not-totally humanlike. Faces that fall just short of being human give us the collective willies. \n\n\n  Avatars used to suck. Then they got better. Now they\u2019ve gotten so good they\u2019ve plunged into the uncanny valley. This was always gonna happen at some point on the road to perfect avatars and that time is now.\n\n   To test it out for myself, I FaceTimed my friend Jules Terpak, who also has a Vision Pro. First I put her across from me at this table while we sat around with each other\u2019s uncanny valley faces for a few minutes.\n\n\n  One very cool thing is that when I moved her window to a different seat at the table, her voice shifted locations to that spot. We concluded that this activity was not actually an upgrade over FaceTime, but that if there were more than two people, it could feel like everyone was sitting around a table together, which would be better than talking to a group FaceTime or Zoom.\n\n\n  Then we shifted locations to Mount Hood.\n\n\n\n  This felt more like we were actually hanging out somewhere, which is an effect you can\u2019t get on FaceTime. \n\n\n  When we started going into apps together, it felt even more like we were actually doing an activity together, in a way you normally can\u2019t do without being in person. \n\n\n   It\u2019s very crude right now, but it\u2019s a primitive version of something we\u2019ll probably all be doing constantly in the 2030s. It\u2019s the next step in a centuries-long human mission to conquer long-distance. First there were letters, then phone calls, then mobile phones3 and video calls. The next step is VR hangouts. \n   By far the thing I spent the most time doing in the Vision Pro was exactly what I normally do, but the AVP version. When you\u2019re sitting down in front of your computer while wearing the headset, you can open your computer screen as a giant virtual window (which you still control with your normal keyboard and trackpad). Whatever screen you\u2019re used to working on is now much, much bigger. It\u2019s also much more mobile. I don\u2019t usually work on the couch because I prefer my big monitor over my laptop screen. This week, I spent a lot of time working on my couch on a 100-inch monitor. I don\u2019t normally work lying flat in bed because the laptop screen isn\u2019t directly above me. This week I did, putting the screen up on the ceiling. I did some work outside on the porch and some more under a tree. Sometimes I saw the room around me, only with a big screen floating in it. Other times, I went fully immersive, writing on a mountain top, a sand dune, or the moon. And as I mentioned at the beginning of the post, I\u2019m currently using the AVP in a coffee shop, which is officially embarrassing. \n   For some odd reason, you can\u2019t open multiple desktops (yet), but you can open some of the things on your desktop as their own apps in separate windows. There\u2019s an AVP iMessage app, so I closed iMessage on my desktop and opened it in an adjacent window. I often remotely cowork with Alicia (WBW\u2019s Manager of Lots of Things), putting her in a little window in the corner of my screen. Now, she\u2019s in her own window. If I\u2019m willing to bite the bullet and switch from Chrome to Safari, I can pull my research and web browsing off the desktop too. The end result is that a single small, immobile computer screen has been replaced with a giant mosaic of screens, for the small price of having a snorkeling mask on my face all day. It kind of feels like you stepped into your computer screen, into the beautiful wallpaper landscape, amongst the windows. Very surreal. I wrote this entire post in the headset and have found myself enjoying writing more\u2014and being more focused\u2014than normal. \nMy overall feelings\n\n\n  The best way I can describe how I feel about the Vision Pro is a strange combination of utterly thunderstruck and mildly underwhelmed. \n\n\n  The magical interface, the giant screens, the immersive experiences\u2014they\u2019re just unfathomably cool and awe-inspiring. It feels like a sneak peek at the 2030s.\n\n\n  But after a couple of days, I found myself thinking, \u201cIs that\u2026it?\u201d I had done the small handful of immersive experiences, played some of the small selection of games, looked at a bunch of my panoramic photos, and tried avatar FaceTime\u2014and at the moment, there\u2019s just not that much else to do in the Vision Pro.\n\n\n  The first iPhone left me feeling the same combination of blown away and bored. The phone and I had a torrid honeymoon, but after the novelty of the interface wore off, all it had to offer was the same 16 practical apps.\n\n\n\n  There was no app store yet, it dropped calls constantly, and the cellular internet (which you couldn\u2019t use while on a call) was painfully slow. The iPhone wasn\u2019t a world-changing device yet. It was the seed from which a world-changing device would grow.\n\n\n  If you zoom out on a story of technology, you usually see a big exponential curve.\n\n\n\n  But if you look at the curve up close, you see that it\u2019s wavy, made of S-curves.\n\n\n\n  The first iPhone was such a big deal because it launched a new S. Investors had a new place to pour their money. Developers had a new place to pour their efforts. Creators had a new place to pour their talents. As millions of human hours worked on the collective human project, the next five years were a whirlwind of innovation and excitement. Apple\u2019s keynotes became a must-watch for anyone interested in tech, as each jump between the iPhone 1 > 3G > 3GS > 4 > 4S > 5 was a major leap in hardware and software. It was the steep part of the S.\n\n\n\n  Then, the keynotes got boring. The changes were incremental. Apple stopped innovating and started refining. This coincided with Tim Cook taking over, but it isn\u2019t his fault. The steep part of the S-curve doesn\u2019t go on forever, and companies often reap the biggest rewards in the boring, top part of the S once the industry matures.\n\n\n  Maybe the reason VR has been slow to take off isn\u2019t because there\u2019s something fundamentally wrong with VR. Maybe it\u2019s because, for the last decade, we\u2019ve been working our way through the very early part of the VR S-curve\u2014the slow part where foundational technology is researched and built. My Vision Pro is highly imperfect\u2014overpriced, heavy, slightly glitchy, very limited, creepy-avatared\u2014because that\u2019s exactly what products are like at the bottom of the S. Consumer products aren\u2019t ready for mass adoption during this stage. But it\u2019s the breakthroughs made during these years that set the stage for the explosive exponential phase of the curve.\n\n   The lesson from past VR hype cycles is to temper expectations. The VR S-Curve explosion may be many years away or never come at all. But the lesson from past Apple launches is don\u2019t bet against Apple, and Apple\u2019s bet is that the Vision Pro could be a seed like the first iPhone\u2014a platform for innovation that kicks a new S-curve into high gear.4 \nVision Pro, V2 \u2013 V10\n\n\n  For someone to regularly use a piece of technology, the benefits have to outweigh the costs. Right now, the Vision Pro benefits are probably less than the costs.\n\n\n\n\n   I\u2019ve already paid for mine, which removes one of the costs, and it\u2019s still a question to what extent I\u2019ll choose it over my computer in the long run. In that regard, the AVP might currently be more like those first cell phones you had to carry around with a briefcase than the first iPhone. Would you get a cell phone if the only way they came was attached a briefcase? Maybe, but it\u2019s a close call. \n\n  For VR to achieve mass adoption, the good needs to be better and the bad needs to be less bad. It\u2019s easy to imagine a pathway to both.\n\n\n  The operating system will get better each year. The two-finger pinch is currently the only gesture. More will be added. Eventually, there may be dozens of ways to make gestures with our fingers, each one a different command, like today\u2019s keyboard shortcuts. When you spend ten minutes setting up an elaborate configuration of windows, you\u2019ll be able to save (and share) it.\n\n\n  Avatars will go from uncanny valley to indistinguishable from your normal face. When you go into immersive environments, you can currently see only your hands. In the future, you\u2019ll be able to identify other objects to remain visible (like a coffee mug). The environments around you will expand from the six current options to hundreds, including delightful fantasy worlds, and they\u2019ll be interactive, allowing you to change things like the weather.\n\n   The hardware will get continually smaller and more comfortable. The resolution and frame rate will become as advanced as the latency. The battery will get way better. So will the look from the outside: to people in the room, the headset will come to look totally transparent. (My personal fantasy: The computer itself becomes detachable, allowing the headset to be a light, sleek, cool-looking visor. The computer and battery snap together into something the size of a smartphone. You\u2019ll be able to snap it to the back of your visor if you don\u2019t want the cord, but most people will prefer the weight to be somewhere other than their heads. The computer/battery rectangle will also have a screen and function as a smartphone for times when you want to do something with the visor off. The visor will fold neatly onto the rectangle to make the whole thing a single compact object.)\n\n  Finally, the amount of content, applications, and experiences will multiply by 1,000-fold, just like the apps in the app store did from 2008 to today. There will be a wide array of immersive games and entertainment. People will watch sports from one of many vantage points on the field, sideline, stands, or overhead\u2014next to their friends, who will be able to look at each other and talk as well as if they were actually together in person. Pop stars will play in front of 50,000 people in person and 5 million people virtually. Fitness will become fun, interactive, and social. The best teachers and coaches will reach millions of people. Amazing AI teachers could reach billions. Distance will melt away, allowing people to spend high-quality time with their loved ones, no matter where they are. People who couldn\u2019t dream of traveling the world today will get to enjoy vivid experiences anywhere on the globe. Of course, my silly 2024 imagination can\u2019t scratch the surface any more than people in the briefcase phone days could have predicted Uber, TikTok, or Tinder.\n\n\n  Over time, the price will come down, with some companies making headsets dirt cheap the way they have for smartphones today. As the value proposition gets better and better, more people will have them, enhancing the social component and eradicating any stigma. Mass adoption seems like a very real future possibility.\n\n   I know what many of you are thinking: A world where everyone is in VR headsets (or visors, or glasses, or contact lenses) sounds dystopian and awful. And granted, this is coming from a guy who thought that world of glazed over people in moving chairs in Wall-E looked like a great place to live\u2014but I\u2019m excited.\n\n  K can I take this thing off my face now?\n\n_______\nWhat to read next:\nA post about a technology even more intense than VR\nA post about a different technology that\u2019s also even more intense than VR\nA post about a third technology that\u2019s even more intense than VR\n_______\n\nIf you like Wait But Why, sign up for our email list and we\u2019ll send you new posts when they come out.\nTo support Wait But Why, visit our Patreon page.\nWhen you use the Quest 2 in a new setting, you have to manually show the headset the boundaries of the open space you\u2019re going to be using.

For information on the previous deprecation of Google+ for users with personal Google accounts, please see this post.\u00a0What's ChangingLast year, we announced plans to wind down Currents, to focus efforts on community experiences that are better integrated with the rest of Google Workspace. To help our customers manage this transition, we published detailed guidance for Workspace administrators and enabled customers to opt-in for automated migration of Currents data to spaces in Google Chat.\u00a0We are nearing the end of this transition. Beginning July 5, 2023, Currents will no longer be available. Workspace administrators can export Currents data using Takeout before August 8, 2023. Beginning August 8th, Currents data will no longer be available for download.\u00a0Although we are saying goodbye to Currents, we continue to invest in new features for Google Chat, so teams can connect and collaborate with a shared sense of belonging. Over the last year, we've delivered features designed to support community engagement at scale, and will continue to deliver more. Here is a summary of the features with additional details below:\u00a0This month, we\u2019re enabling new ways for organizations to share information across the enterprise with announcements in Google Chat. This gives admin controls to limit permissions for posting in a space, while enabling all members to read and react, helping ensure that important updates stay visible and relevant. Later this year, we plan to simplify membership management by integrating Google Groups with spaces in Chat, enable post-level metrics for announcements, and provide tools for Workspace administrators to manage spaces across their domain.\u00a0Announcements in Google ChatManaging space membership with Google GroupsWe\u2019ve already rolled out new ways to make conversations more expressive and engaging such as in-line threading to enable rich exploration of a specific topic without overtaking the main conversation and custom emojis to enable fun, personal expression.In-line threaded conversationsDiscover and join communities with up to 8,000 membersWe\u2019ve also made it easier for individuals to discover and join communities of shared interest. By searching in Gmail, users can explore a directory of available spaces covering topics of personal or professional interest such as gardening, pets, career development, fitness, cultural identity, and more, with the ability to invite others to join via link. Last year, we increased the size of communities supported by spaces in Chat to 8,000 members, and we are working to scale this in a meaningful way later this year.\u00a0A directory of spaces in Google Chat for users to join.As communities grow, it\u2019s essential to provide tools for content moderation and data management. Last year, we introduced space managers, a community lead with abilities to moderate conversation and manage membership, and last year at NEXT, we rolled out data loss prevention (DLP) for Chat. We will continue to enhance community health and data security for Google Chat.\u00a0Our partner community is extending the power of Chat through integrations with essential third-party apps such as Jira, GitHub, Asana, PagerDuty, Zendesk and Salesforce. Many organizations have built custom workflow apps using low-code and no-code tools, and we anticipate that this number will continue to grow with the GA releases of the Chat API and AppSheet\u2019s Chat app building capabilities later this year.For teams to thrive in this rapidly changing era of hybrid work, it\u2019s essential to build authentic personal connections and a strong sense of belonging, no matter when or where individuals work. We will continue to make Google Chat the best option for Workspace customers seeking to build a community and culture for hybrid teams, with much more to come later this year.\u00a0Who's impactedAdmins and end usersWhy it\u2019s importantThe transition from Currents to spaces in Google Chat removes a separate, siloed destination and provides organizations with a modern, enterprise-grade experience that reflects how the world is working today. Google Workspace customers use Google Chat to communicate about projects, share organizational updates, and build community. \nRecommended action Admins: Review the Change Management Guide. Use Takeout to explore your organization\u2019s Currents data before August 8, 2023.

Just two weeks after the book launch, my first baby would be born. I\u2019d promote the book, catch my breath, and then begin the new adventure.\nThank god for those critical two weeks.\nThe night before book launch was (obviously) a frantic all-nighter, and I eventually went to bed after 40 hours awake, exhausted and satisfied. We had done it. The book was live. It was over. I\u2019d actually wake up tomorrow without this project hanging over my head. The sky would be blue. I\u2019d finally be free.\nI woke up close to noon and felt at peace for three seconds before opening my phone and seeing three texts from my wife:\n\nHm?\nI knew what water breaking was. But I didn\u2019t know what it meant. Is the baby coming out now? Or was this one of the false alarms I had heard about and the baby is still a couple weeks away? Is there a chance she just peed her pants and is misdiagnosing the situation?\nAfter some rapid-fire googling, one thing was clear: We had to go to the hospital. Now.\nThe drive was weird. I had pictured myself heroically driving a screaming labor-having wife to the hospital, but here I was driving normally to the hospital with a very normal wife next to me. Apart from her new leaking situation, nothing was different than it was yesterday. There was no way we were actually having a baby today. Right?\nUpon arrival, the PA assessed things and yes her water had broken, and yes in order to avoid infection that meant the baby had to come out now. Two hours and 12 canceled book-promoting podcasts later, we\u2019re in our delivery room, where my still-not-in-labor wife would supposedly be producing a baby sometime later today.\nAgain, there was a major expectations-reality gap. I had pictured the day of my first child\u2019s birth being impossibly frenetic and emotional and intense. But there we were, eating animal crackers and gummies from the treats-you-can-eat-while-in-labor bag, hanging out and chatting like any other day.\nMy wife was hooked up to a bunch of tubes and machines and the plan was to see if contractions would start on their own as a reaction to her water breaking, but a few hours passed and nothing happened. Eventually, the nurse came in and poured a magical little chemical called Pitocin into her IV bag. \nAnd things started happening.\nContractions began, which my wife described as \u201ca really bad period cramp,\u201d which helped me understand what they felt like 0%. Over the next couple hours they got worse and worse. I was quickly assigned the role of \u201cdon\u2019t say or do anything\u201d while contractions were happening, so I\u2019d just kind of sit there awkwardly and watch with this face on:\n\nHer epidural plan was something like \u201cdefinitely get one but tough it out a little first,\u201d and after a particularly awful contraction, she called it a day and the epidural team came in to do their thing. 45 minutes later, we\u2019re back in the \u201cI know this is the day of the birth of our first child but it sure doesn\u2019t feel like it\u201d zone, chatting and hanging out normally. After a few more hours, a nurse came in and checked on the dilation situation and was like \u201calright, let\u2019s do this!\u201d\nOnce again, nothing like I pictured. I thought there would be a big team of doctors and nurses doing a whole big hectic thing and I\u2019d be standing somewhere on the side. Instead, it was me and this nurse, each holding a leg.\n\nThe game went like this: When a contraction starts, we each grab a leg and she pushes really hard for 10 seconds three times in a row. Then everyone chills and hangs out for a few minutes until the next contraction. And repeat.\nAfter a few rounds of this, it was clear this was not gonna work. Nothing was coming out. But we kept trying anyway.\nAnd then I saw it.\nThe edge of an upsetting slimy pancake.\n\nWhen I asked what the upsetting slimy pancake edge was, the nurse told me it was my daughter.\nUh huh.\nThis then went on for a while. We\u2019d do a round of pushing, the upsetting pancake thing would come out a centimeter and then go back in, and each round it would come out a few more millimeters. It was increasingly feeling like we really weren\u2019t getting anywhere with this strategy when the nurse suddenly says \u201cokay let\u2019s deliver a baby!\u201d\nShe makes a call and a few minutes later a group of people come in, including the first doctor we had seen that day. The next contraction came along, I leg-held, my wife pushed, and then in the most surreal moment of my life, I was staring at a tiny screaming alien.\n\n___________\nThat was 3 months ago. I\u2019ve had a lot of thoughts since then. Here are 10 of them:\n1) A newborn is not a baby\nI thought it was gonna be like this:\n\nBut it\u2019s actually like this:\n\nA newborn is not a baby. Babies are cute and roly-poly and can see and are conscious and are normal and a newborn is not any of these things. It is a bizarre human larva that acts super weird and would still be in the womb if it could be. The problem is, when humans went bipedal, our pelvises got smaller, and as humans got smarter, our heads got bigger. So evolution had to get creative. Its solution: all human babies would be premies, born when they were still small enough to pass through a human pelvis. The last couple months as a fetus would happen outside the womb, and everyone would just have to deal with that. This became incredibly obvious during the first month with my daughter. She was a raw human id not remotely ready for primetime. Thankfully, since then, a baby has grown around the id and now she has the figure of a miniature 390-pound 84-year-old woman.1\n2) It is insane that there\u2019s not some required training for new-parents-to-be\nIf I want to drive a car, I have to take driver\u2019s ed first. If I want to provide medical advice, I have to go to med school first. But after we had the baby, the hospital was like \u201cdon\u2019t shake it k bye.\u201d\nI know a lot of words I didn\u2019t used to know. Meconium. Tummy time. Latching. Bicycling. Swaddle. Colostrum. I know how many ounces of milk and hours of sleep the baby is supposed to have each day. I know baby CPR and the baby Heimlich maneuver. I know how to induce baby burps and shits. I know how warmly to dress a baby. I know what temperature baby bathwater should be. I know what sleep training is and when it\u2019s okay to start it. I know that you can\u2019t just pick a newborn up, you have to pick all the pieces up at the same time or else the pieces fall off.\n\nBut I only know all of these things because I read books and articles and am fortunate to have people I can call with questions. And society\u2019s current plan is to just expect/hope that every new parent does the same?? There should obviously be like a mandatory four-hour course every expecting parent has to take before they\u2019re actually in charge of a newborn.\nInstead, people like to say things like \u201cyou\u2019ll figure it out\u201d and \u201cjust use your instincts.\u201d You could apply the same logic to driving and people probably would just figure it out\u2014but we don\u2019t do it that way, because that would be absurd.\n3) Babies have giant heads*\n\n*I made this visual thinking it was gonna emphasize how big baby heads are, but after looking at the big-headed guy on the right for a while, it started to look normal to me, and the normal-headed guy suddenly looked like he had a ridiculously small head. So now I\u2019m realizing that the big takeaway is that baby heads are normal and the rest of our heads are tiny.\n4) Babies are incredibly overdramatic\nWhen a normal person is hungry, or tired, or needs to burp, they\u2019re a little annoyed. Babies are in Shakespearean agony. And then comes the burp and one second later they\u2019re like \u201csup.\u201d It\u2019s insane behavior.\nFor a while, the range of baby emotion runs from Shakespearean agony to neutral, never entering the positive realm. Neutral is a newborn\u2019s best-case scenario.\n\nAfter six weeks or so, positive emotion begins to make an appearance, but then they still go apoplectic at the slightest inconvenience.2\nWhile we\u2019re here, I know it\u2019s bad but I can\u2019t help it\u2014crying babies are funny. My wife completely disagrees with me on this.\n\n5) The parent-newborn relationship is super one-sided\n\nIt\u2019s weird\u2014you have all of these intense feelings for this little person* and there\u2019s just nothing to do with those feelings. I could squish her face, but then she\u2019d cry and I\u2019d be abusing a baby. In the early weeks, there\u2019s just not really a satisfying outlet for your baby fondness and it\u2019s annoying.\nOne other one-sided thing is you\u2019re apparently supposed to talk to your newborn even though they\u2019re an unconscious fetus because it supposedly helps develop their brain. So now my baby has heard multiple versions of my next book outline, the full story of the rise and fall of the Assyrian Empire after I listened to a podcast about it, and a list of every World Series champion going back to 1990. Never once has the baby shown any sign of being affected by any of this.\n*That said, I\u2019ve always thought of parental love as the most intense form of love\u2014the kind where if you had a Sophie\u2019s choice where your baby and spouse were both hanging off a cliff and you could only save one, you\u2019d save the baby without a second thought. And\u2026yeah I\u2019m not there yet. I love this little creature a freakish amount, but as of now, I\u2019m definitely saving my wife in that situation. Sorry kiddo. I\u2019m sure Tim the Baby-Saver-Wife-Dropper will at some point emerge, but I guess it takes some time.\n6) Babies shit all over your schedule\nObvious one, I know, but just check this out:1\n\n\n\nThese are the sleep graphs of three different babies, but they all have one thing in common: there\u2019s no rhyme or reason in the early months, because newborns are dicks.\n7) It\u2019s mathematically impossible to know if your baby is cute or not\nI think my baby is impossibly adorable, of course, but every parent thinks that about their baby, so that offers no information. Everyone who has met her or seen a picture of her has commented on how cute she is, but they\u2019d say that no matter what she looked like\u2014which I know as someone who has commented on the cuteness of babies ranging from perfect to hideous\u2014so there\u2019s no information there either. FYI, I once depicted what happens when friends visit someone with an uncute baby:\n\n\n\n\n\n8) I\u2019m a motor skills virtuoso\nIt\u2019s pretty amazing how bad babies are at everything. They\u2019re terrible at thinking, at knowing anything, at moving all parts of their body. The cool thing is that spending time with a super unimpressive baby has made me super impressed by myself. Like I\u2019ll watch the baby sitting in a baby bouncer trying to reach for a little wooden flower one foot in front of her and she just flings her arm in the general direction and misses by a lot. Then I\u2019ll reach for a glass of water and all of my joints work together to send my hand on a perfectly straight path through three-dimensional space, gracefully clasp my fingers around it using the perfect amount of pressure, raise it to my mouth, tilt it in perfect sync with the movement of my lips, and then return the glass to the table and gently place it down like an absolute genius.\n9) You don\u2019t go from a non-parent to a parent overnight\nSome things are just too big for our little human brains to fully absorb. The bigness of the universe. The permanence of death. The magnitude of the marriage decision, which I once described like this:\nWhen you choose a life partner, you\u2019re choosing a lot of things, including your parenting partner and someone who will deeply influence your children, your eating companion for about 20,000 meals, your travel companion for about 100 vacations, your primary leisure time and retirement friend, your career therapist, and someone whose day you\u2019ll hear about 18,000 times. Intense shit.\nA few months into fatherhood, this feels like another item in that category. When your baby is born, you will (hopefully) never live another day as a non-parent. For people who make the decision to do this, it is the BC-AD line of their life. It doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t still be you, but you are trading in one kind of life for another, with all of the pros and cons that come along with it.\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been able to quite wrap my head around the bigness of the situation. A curious childless friend asked me the other day if I feel like a dad, and I surprised myself by answering \u201cnot really.\u201d I mostly feel like old me that has this new delightful little thing living in my house. When I see friends with sentient kids actually parenting them, saying things like \u201cthat\u2019s not nice, stop it,\u201d whatever that must be like is as much of a mystery to me as it was three months ago. For me at least, it seems like a parent is something you slowly turn into as your first baby slowly turns into a person.\nBtw I\u2019m now even more convinced than I was before that this is the most personal of personal decisions and no one should ever try to pressure anyone else to have kids\u2014it\u2019s way too big a thing to be anyone else\u2019s business.\n10) Having a baby really makes you think about the future\nEvery parent in history has brought their baby into a world with an uncertain future. But our future is the uncertainest. My baby might live a life a lot like mine, just a little more futuristic. Or she might live to 500. She might live most of her life with a brain-machine interface implanted in her head, thinking with her own superintelligent AI. She might suffer through civilizational collapse. She might live in a world that would seem like utopia to us today. She might live on Mars. She might meet aliens. She might die in the apocalypse. There\u2019s just no way to know. It makes all of those fun, exciting, terrifying conversations about the future hit just a little harder.\n\n_______\n\nIf you like Wait But Why, sign up for our email list and we\u2019ll send you new

For information on the previous deprecation of Google+ for users with personal Google accounts, please see this post.\u00a0What's ChangingLast year, we announced plans to wind down Currents, to focus efforts on community experiences that are better integrated with the rest of Google Workspace. To help our customers manage this transition, we published detailed guidance for Workspace administrators and enabled customers to opt-in for automated migration of Currents data to spaces in Google Chat.\u00a0We are nearing the end of this transition. Beginning July 5, 2023, Currents will no longer be available. Workspace administrators can export Currents data using Takeout before August 8, 2023. Beginning August 8th, Currents data will no longer be available for download.\u00a0Although we are saying goodbye to Currents, we continue to invest in new features for Google Chat, so teams can connect and collaborate with a shared sense of belonging. Over the last year, we've delivered features designed to support community engagement at scale, and will continue to deliver more. Here is a summary of the features with additional details below:\u00a0This month, we\u2019re enabling new ways for organizations to share information across the enterprise with announcements in Google Chat. This gives admin controls to limit permissions for posting in a space, while enabling all members to read and react, helping ensure that important updates stay visible and relevant. Later this year, we plan to simplify membership management by integrating Google Groups with spaces in Chat, enable post-level metrics for announcements, and provide tools for Workspace administrators to manage spaces across their domain.\u00a0Announcements in Google ChatManaging space membership with Google GroupsWe\u2019ve already rolled out new ways to make conversations more expressive and engaging such as in-line threading to enable rich exploration of a specific topic without overtaking the main conversation and custom emojis to enable fun, personal expression.In-line threaded conversationsDiscover and join communities with up to 8,000 membersWe\u2019ve also made it easier for individuals to discover and join communities of shared interest. By searching in Gmail, users can explore a directory of available spaces covering topics of personal or professional interest such as gardening, pets, career development, fitness, cultural identity, and more, with the ability to invite others to join via link. Last year, we increased the size of communities supported by spaces in Chat to 8,000 members, and we are working to scale this in a meaningful way later this year.\u00a0A directory of spaces in Google Chat for users to join.As communities grow, it\u2019s essential to provide tools for content moderation and data management. Last year, we introduced space managers, a community lead with abilities to moderate conversation and manage membership, and last year at NEXT, we rolled out data loss prevention (DLP) for Chat. We will continue to enhance community health and data security for Google Chat.\u00a0Our partner community is extending the power of Chat through integrations with essential third-party apps such as Jira, GitHub, Asana, PagerDuty, Zendesk and Salesforce. Many organizations have built custom workflow apps using low-code and no-code tools, and we anticipate that this number will continue to grow with the GA releases of the Chat API and AppSheet\u2019s Chat app building capabilities later this year.For teams to thrive in this rapidly changing era of hybrid work, it\u2019s essential to build authentic personal connections and a strong sense of belonging, no matter when or where individuals work. We will continue to make Google Chat the best option for Workspace customers seeking to build a community and culture for hybrid teams, with much more to come later this year.\u00a0Who's impactedAdmins and end usersWhy it\u2019s importantThe transition from Currents to spaces in Google Chat removes a separate, siloed destination and provides organizations with a modern, enterprise-grade experience that reflects how the world is working today. Google Workspace customers use Google Chat to communicate about projects, share organizational updates, and build community. \nRecommended action Admins: Review the Change Management Guide. Use Takeout to explore your organization\u2019s Currents data before August 8, 2023.

Obama was president, the Cavs were on their way to beating the Warriors in the NBA finals, Game of Thrones was still good, and I was 34 years old with my whole life ahead of me.\nWait But Why had been around for three years, a stretch during which I wrote about 100 blog posts on dozens of topics. On the afternoon of June 18, 2016, I was sitting on the couch engaging in a familiar ritual: looking through my list of future post ideas, trying to pick my next topic. And then I had a thought.\nSo many of the post ideas I was scanning through were about the future. Virtual reality. Artificial intelligence. Genetic engineering. Life extension. Multiplanetary expansion. But lately, it felt like there was a cloud hanging over all these topics.\nMy urge to write about the future comes from an excited optimism that\u2019s fundamental to my personality. I believe at a deep level that the future is going to be an amazing, exhilarating ride, and nothing is more fun than learning about cutting edge developments that can offer clues into what magic might lie down the road.\nBut on June 18, 2016, I didn\u2019t feel excitedly optimistic. There was a different feel to the world than there had been in my previous blogging years. Something seemed off about the society around me, like there had been a subtle, foreboding shift in the balance between reason and madness. It felt like we were losing our grip on something important.\nThe fun thing about being a blogger is you can write about whatever the fuck you want. And a good compass for me had always been that if something was incessantly on my mind, it was probably a good post topic. So I decided to write what I call a \u201cmini post.\u201d\nWait But Why articles are long, and they go deep. I bathe in the topic for a little while, dread writing it for a little while, then finally pump it out, draw the drawings, give it a read, and post. A mini-post is much chiller\u2014I just open WordPress and type what\u2019s on my mind, and post it.\nSo I opened WordPress to write a little post about that cloud I felt hovering over my other post topics. I\u2019d knock out a draft tonight, give it a read tomorrow, and publish it.\n\nBut nothing came out. I didn\u2019t know where to start.\nThere were a bunch of bad trends: Tribalism was flaring up everywhere, mass shaming campaigns were roaring back into fashion, politicians were increasingly clown-like, public discourse had become a battle of one-dimensional narratives. But why was all of this happening now? Was the problem related to social media? To politics or current events? Was it some broader cultural or psychological phenomenon?\nI also noticed that I wasn\u2019t feeling the normal confidence I felt when I started a new post. Something about this topic felt scary. I never felt scared to write about anything before. This fear of writing about this topic seemed like it was an important part of the topic.\nNope. Not a mini-post. I needed the full week for this one.\n\nBut a funny thing happened that week. I didn\u2019t write anything. Instead, I started jotting down notes and ideas in a Text Edit document called \u201csociety\u201d that quickly became long and messy. I abandoned that document and opened up \u201csociety 2\u201d to give myself a fresh start. Soon there was a Society folder with seven note documents.\nI could have just stopped there. Too big a topic, too out of my wheelhouse, too icky, too scary. An outline for a virtual reality post was sitting right there in my Future Posts folder waiting for me.\nBut I\u2019m really, really bad with the sunk cost fallacy. I had already put so much time and thought in, and I couldn\u2019t handle all of it being for nothing.\nAnd so began the next six years of my life.\nI wish I could say that I actively decided to put everything else aside and write a giant opus on the problems with my society. But it didn\u2019t happen like that. If you asked me at any point over the past six years when I was gonna be done with my society post\u2014and plenty of people did\u2014the answer was always, \u201cI\u2019m finally getting close.\u201d And I believed it every time. I fully believed, every time, that this thing was almost done. The delusion of a madman.\nAnd the problem with this particular delusion is that it\u2019s a perfect way to ruin your life. If I believed I was working on a six-year project, I\u2019d have worked the project into my normal life. I\u2019d get into a rhythm that would allow for a work-life balance. But when you think you\u2019re at most a couple months from finishing a big project, it makes sense to put everything else on hold for just a little bit more until the project is done. I wasn\u2019t someone who never made fun plans or who worked on every vacation or who took a lot of Vyvanse\u2014I was someone who did those things just for right now, because I\u2019m in crunch time on a big project. For six years.\nIn May of 2017, I asked my girlfriend to marry me. We had been dating since 2011. She had seen the whole Wait But Why journey up close and had now been living with \u201cI\u2019m almost done with this big project\u201d Tim for a year. We set our wedding date for October of 2018. Thank god by then I\u2019d be out of this pit and working on all kinds of other fun projects.\nBut instead of the project wrapping up, it just got bigger.\n\nThe topic had led me down dozens of totally different rabbit holes, and everything I read seemed relevant to it. I don\u2019t like telling a partial story. Like I had in other posts, I was determined to tell the full, full story. If I noticed something in my reading or on social media or in the news that seemed like an important piece of the puzzle, it had to be incorporated. If that fucked up the current outline, then the outline would have to adapt.\nThe problem is that the outlines became ridiculous. I couldn\u2019t keep it all in my head at once, so I made sub-outlines, and sub-sub-outlines. The Society folder now looked like this:\n \nAs 2017 became 2018, I decided that the wedding would be the hard deadline that I needed. My girlfriend had spent way too much time with an \u201cI\u2019m almost done with this massive post on society\u201d boyfriend. She would have a much more pleasant husband.\nI\u2019m still not sure how I turned into a crazy person. The way to proceed was obvious. I should pick a piece of this albatross, throw the rest away, and focus in on it. Do what I had done for years\u2014suck it up, get serious, knock something out, and move on with my life.\nBut I\u2019m a nightmare of a perfectionist and knew that the ultimate prize was to figure out how to not focus in but capture it all in a single, overarching story. It all was one big story, and I wanted to tell it.\nWedding day came and went.\n\nPeople in my life were worried about me. They tried encouraging me, shaming me, setting deadlines for me, reminding me that one post really shouldn\u2019t take multiple years. Nothing seemed to help.\nFinally, in mid-2019, I hatched a plan that would once and for all end this thing. Rather than post a gargantuan blog post, I\u2019d make it a series. This would break it into parts, which is less daunting. Plus, I had learned that the adrenaline of knowing that my readers were only days away from seeing what I was working on was a huge motivator that I had been sorely missing.\nI called it The Story of Us and in August of 2019, the first chapter went up. The whole thing would be 12 chapters, I decided, and even though the chapters got longer as they went, and the time between them expanded, it was finally happening\u2014I was publishing the damn thing. The end was near.\nThen came Chapter 11. The first 10 chapters had introduced the core framework of the series and talked broadly about the big picture of what I thought our problem was. In Chapter 11, I was going to dip into more controversial territory, looking at the past few years of news stories through the lens of the framework we had developed.\nIt turns out I had a lot more to say about what was going on around me than I had anticipated. Soon, my draft of Chapter 11 was longer than the first ten chapters combined. I have problems.\nNow it was the middle of 2020. Covid was in full swing. Thousands of people were marching by my apartment in protest. It was a seismic year for American society. Everything I was writing about was happening, and rapidly evolving, literally outside my window. What I had written months earlier suddenly seemed stale. Also, Chapter 11 was over 100,000 words. Death.\nIt started to dawn on me that I really needed to just turn this into a book. Between the mountains of feedback I had gotten from readers and friends on The Story of Us and the mountains of new thoughts I had about all the recent developments in the world, I knew that there was one way to really bring the project from hell home: open a blank Microsoft Word document and write a newer, better, complete story, and do it in a book format that people could read more easily than a web page. Somewhere, a fairy died.\nSo I started writing the book. I\u2019d call it the name it should have always been called: What\u2019s Our Problem? I knew what I wanted to say. I just had to write it.\nI finished V1 in December of 2021 and triumphantly tweeted about it.\n\nDone! In a sense! It was 250,000 words, which is about 150,000 words too long. And missing most of the drawings. And I had a giant \u201cADD IN\u201d document full of news stories which had happened in the year and a half since I started writing the book that would need to be incorporated.\nIt\u2019s hard to cut writing. Perfectionism, sunk costs, etc. Procrastination abound. I would try to cut a section down, polish it off, and move on, but kept finding myself rewriting the section entirely. I was moving at a snail\u2019s pace.\nThen one day in June of 2022, my wife woke me up by handing me a positive pregnancy stick. It was a surreal, joyful moment. I\u2019ve never been anyone\u2019s dad before but always wanted to be. Then the thought hit me.\n\nNOPE. 100% no. It could not happen. This baby could not enter a world where this project was still going on. Suddenly, an old friend entered the room.\n\n  \nThe baby was due on March 7, 2023, so this book would be completely done by mid-February, period end of story.\nV2 got finished (July 2022). Then V3 (September). Then V4 (December). Editors and fact-checkers and copy editors and ebook designers and audiobook engineers were hired. Alicia (Wait But Why\u2019s Manager of Lots of Things, who had already put in thousands of hours helping with every element of the process), went into crazy crunch time mode. I sat in a booth for 45 hours reading the audiobook (January). The ebook was designed (February). The launch date was set.\n\nIt took 2,440 days, but my mini-post on society is done and coming out on Tuesday. Fuckin shit.\n\nHere are the pages:\n\nSome stats:\n\n121,000 words\n303 drawings\n11,081 documents in my Society folder\nI\u2019m 41\nA condensed and re-written Story of Us makes up 25% of the book. The rest is all new.\n\nThis book is my best crack at explaining what I think is an existential risk to liberal societies and what I think we need to do to get to that awesome future I used to be so excited about. There are dozens of concepts in the book that serve as a kind of toolbox for understanding our societies, our group dynamics, and our own minds. I\u2019m very proud of the final product and never want to have an experience like this again.\nIf you would like to take my last six years and put it into your brain, here are the different options (all available on Tuesday Feb 21):\nEbook: Available on most major platforms (you can also buy the EPUB directly). It looks best on color e-readers and tablets (especially on vertical scroll mode), but also fine on phones and black-and-white e-readers. The best ebook experience we\u2019ve seen is Apple Books > iPad > sepia > vertical scroll. Available for preorder on Apple and Kindle \u2013 the rest are available on launch day, Feb 21.\nWait But Why: Without the limitations of the other formats, this is where the drawings can be displayed full-size, where footnotes can be interactive, etc. The downside here is that you can only read it on a tablet or phone, not an e-reader, and there\u2019s no dark mode at the moment. Available here.\nClick here to see how the book looks in different formats\nAudiobook: Available on most major platforms (or you can buy the mp3 directly). Read painstakingly by me. I personally do most of my reading via audiobook, so I tried to make it the best possible experience. The obvious downside is that the book has 300+ visuals, so we made a webpage (and pdf) for audiobook listeners with the 46 most important drawings, numbered. When I get to that point in the reading, I say something like, \u201cGo look at drawing number 24.\u201d Available for preorder on Kobo and on other platforms (Audible, Apple, Spotify, and more) on launch day.\nIf you can\u2019t afford it: I really want everyone who wants to read this book to be able to do so, so if you can\u2019t afford to buy the book, email us at [email\u00a0protected] and we\u2019ll give you a code that lets you read it on WBW for free.\nPrint: There is not a print version, which I know will disappoint some people. There are a few reasons for this, but the biggest one is that printing this big full-color book would have delayed launch by many, many months, and fuck that. UPDATE (2024): The book is now available in print! The physical book is a very big, nice, pretty object, and the drawings look great. Available on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and Bookshop.\nAlso, Idea Labs: A major theme in this book is how we can do better at having productive discussions about tough topics. So we\u2019re planning to create virtual book clubs for anyone who is interested in discussing the book with other WBW readers. More on this soon, but if you\u2019re interested in being part of a book club, enter your email address here.\nSo that\u2019s the story with this book. Can\u2019t wait to hear your thoughts. If you want to be notified on launch day and keep up with whatever else we work on in the future, make sure you\u2019re on our email list.\n___________\nAnother time I did something hard: Doing a TED

For information on the previous deprecation of Google+ for users with personal Google accounts, please see this post.\u00a0What's ChangingLast year, we announced plans to wind down Currents, to focus efforts on community experiences that are better integrated with the rest of Google Workspace. To help our customers manage this transition, we published detailed guidance for Workspace administrators and enabled customers to opt-in for automated migration of Currents data to spaces in Google Chat.\u00a0We are nearing the end of this transition. Beginning July 5, 2023, Currents will no longer be available. Workspace administrators can export Currents data using Takeout before August 8, 2023. Beginning August 8th, Currents data will no longer be available for download.\u00a0Although we are saying goodbye to Currents, we continue to invest in new features for Google Chat, so teams can connect and collaborate with a shared sense of belonging. Over the last year, we've delivered features designed to support community engagement at scale, and will continue to deliver more. Here is a summary of the features with additional details below:\u00a0This month, we\u2019re enabling new ways for organizations to share information across the enterprise with announcements in Google Chat. This gives admin controls to limit permissions for posting in a space, while enabling all members to read and react, helping ensure that important updates stay visible and relevant. Later this year, we plan to simplify membership management by integrating Google Groups with spaces in Chat, enable post-level metrics for announcements, and provide tools for Workspace administrators to manage spaces across their domain.\u00a0Announcements in Google ChatManaging space membership with Google GroupsWe\u2019ve already rolled out new ways to make conversations more expressive and engaging such as in-line threading to enable rich exploration of a specific topic without overtaking the main conversation and custom emojis to enable fun, personal expression.In-line threaded conversationsDiscover and join communities with up to 8,000 membersWe\u2019ve also made it easier for individuals to discover and join communities of shared interest. By searching in Gmail, users can explore a directory of available spaces covering topics of personal or professional interest such as gardening, pets, career development, fitness, cultural identity, and more, with the ability to invite others to join via link. Last year, we increased the size of communities supported by spaces in Chat to 8,000 members, and we are working to scale this in a meaningful way later this year.\u00a0A directory of spaces in Google Chat for users to join.As communities grow, it\u2019s essential to provide tools for content moderation and data management. Last year, we introduced space managers, a community lead with abilities to moderate conversation and manage membership, and last year at NEXT, we rolled out data loss prevention (DLP) for Chat. We will continue to enhance community health and data security for Google Chat.\u00a0Our partner community is extending the power of Chat through integrations with essential third-party apps such as Jira, GitHub, Asana, PagerDuty, Zendesk and Salesforce. Many organizations have built custom workflow apps using low-code and no-code tools, and we anticipate that this number will continue to grow with the GA releases of the Chat API and AppSheet\u2019s Chat app building capabilities later this year.For teams to thrive in this rapidly changing era of hybrid work, it\u2019s essential to build authentic personal connections and a strong sense of belonging, no matter when or where individuals work. We will continue to make Google Chat the best option for Workspace customers seeking to build a community and culture for hybrid teams, with much more to come later this year.\u00a0Who's impactedAdmins and end usersWhy it\u2019s importantThe transition from Currents to spaces in Google Chat removes a separate, siloed destination and provides organizations with a modern, enterprise-grade experience that reflects how the world is working today. Google Workspace customers use Google Chat to communicate about projects, share organizational updates, and build community. \nRecommended action Admins: Review the Change Management Guide. Use Takeout to explore your organization\u2019s Currents data before August 8, 2023.

I picked some for this round, and we\u2019re keeping the rest in a database that I\u2019ll go back to for future mailbags ([email\u00a0protected] is always open, so send questions anytime and we\u2019ll add them to the list).\nThere\u2019s a lot to cover, so let\u2019s get going.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion from my 7-year-old: How many germs would you have to put together to actually be able to see them? What would it look like? \u2013 Kirsten, Zachary\u2019s mum (Sydney, Australia)\nYou\u2019re my kind of guy, Zachary. Let\u2019s discuss.\nThere are a lot of germs out there. A smaller germ, like the virus that causes covid, is 120nm across. The smallest object we can see is about 0.1mm\u2014about the width of a human hair. You\u2019d have to line up about 800 coronaviruses to get to 0.1mm\u2014but that would be a one-dimensional line way too thin to see. To actually see something, you\u2019d have to give it some area and turn the 800-virus line into an 800 x 800 square. That clump of 640,000 viruses would be just big enough to see as a tiny speck.1 As for what it would look like, your guess is as good as mine Zachary.\nI\u2019m never\u00a0good\u00a0at\u00a0stopping once I start on an exploration of size, and doing this answer got me googling all kinds of things.\nLike how big all the bacteria in the human body would be if you clumped it all together. I had always heard the famous stat that there are 10 times as many bacteria in your body as human cells. It turns out that that\u2019s been debunked. The real ratio is closer to 1:1, with both kinds of cells in the ballpark of 40 trillion in an adult human body.2\nAnyway, the NIH estimates that all that bacteria adds up to only 0.3% of a human\u2019s body mass. Zachary is 7, so let\u2019s estimate his mass at 25 kg. That means the bacteria in his body adds up to 75 grams\u2014about the weight of a plum. Assuming the density of Zachary\u2019s bacteria is similar to the density of his body, that would make the bacteria ball about the size of a plum too.\n\nThis led me to the obvious next question: how big would all the bacteria on Earth be if you bunched them all together?3\nThankfully, University of Georgia microbiologist William Whitman has done the hard work of coming up with an estimate for the number of bacteria on Earth: 5 nonillion.\nThat\u2019s 5,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.\nTo couple that estimate with a wild estimate of our own, we can use the volume of an E. coli bacteria (.7\u00b5m3) and assume that\u2019s somewhere around the average size of Earth bacteria. 5 nonillion x .7\u00b5m3 comes out to a cube with a base of about 15km (~9.5mi).\n\nThis massive cube of bacteria covers a large part of Los Angeles and rises higher than the cruising altitude of commercial airplanes. If you were on the ground, it would take a full day to walk around the cube, and it would be a bad experience because the whole day you\u2019d be right next to a vile bacteria cube.\nIf we took a huge butter knife and smeared the cube out evenly on the Earth\u2019s surface, it would cover the entire Earth with a layer of pure bacteria 7mm (1/4 inch) thick, and everything would be gross.\nK let\u2019s move on.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think of scientists putting mini human brains in mice? Where do you think this kind of science could lead in the future? \u2013\u00a0Leah N. (Quincy, IL)\nI have no idea what\u2019s going on with this question but it\u2019s now all I care about. I\u2019m picturing a world with tiny field mice with human intelligence. They\u2019d form tiny societies run by tiny iron-fisted mouse tyrants. They could have little academies and do research on mice-related things. They might organize a mouse Olympics that we could televise and bet on. Some people would befriend mice and some might even choose to get married to mice. I hope this is what you\u2019re talking about Leah, and I refuse to look it up because I\u2019m sure whatever you\u2019re actually talking about will be a huge letdown.\n\n\n\nDrugs: do you do them? What do you think of them? \u2013\u00a0Tom C. (Nottingham, UK)\nKind of what I think of cars. Cars can be incredibly useful, fun, and life-changing if you understand how cars work and know how to drive safely. If you don\u2019t know anything about driving or you tend to drive recklessly, you\u2019re probably not ready to use cars.\n\n\n\nWhy do we prefer to watch a film we haven\u2019t watched before but we want to listen to songs that we have heard hundreds of times? \u2013 Anastasia S. (Athens, Greece)\nMany films are the most fun the first time because a part of our brains loses itself in the plot and actually experiences what the characters are experiencing, to an extent. Part of why that\u2019s so fun is the uncertainty, which makes it like a real-life adventure. Once we know what\u2019s going to happen, the experience is less exciting for the same reason an adventure would be less exciting if you already knew how everything was gonna play out.\nA song works the opposite way. Not knowing where the song is going can be intellectually interesting, but what our brain really wants to do is mentally dance with the song, and it can\u2019t do that if it doesn\u2019t know the \u201csteps.\u201d That\u2019s why a catchy song is only okay the first time but it can quickly become orgasmic after we hear it a few times and our brains get the hang of it. Once our brain memorizes a song, the song has a special pathway carved in our heads and it feels great to light that pathway up by hearing the song (and if we don\u2019t give our brain the chance, it might just start lighting up the pathway itself, and the song gets \u201cstuck in your head\u201d).4\nBack to films, the thing is, a film isn\u2019t just a plot. It can also be a piece of art, which is why in some cases, we do like to watch films (or TV shows) repeatedly (I\u2019ve seen The Shawshank Redemption, Back to the Future, Shutter Island, and The\u00a0Office (UK) like 9 times each).\n\n\n\nWhat age range do you currently think you\u2019re\u00a0most likely\u00a0to die (disregarding cryonics)?\nMultiple choice:\n\n70\u2013100\n100\u2013125\n125\u2013150\n150\u2013250\n250+\n\n\u2013\u00a0Sean M. (New Orleans, LA)\nThe pessimistic part of my brain says: A) 70\u2013100. My grandparents lived to 84, 87, 91, and good old Nana is still going strong at 95.5 My lifestyle is not a big enough step above theirs, healthwise, to imagine that I\u2019ll beat them out by very much. And sure, medicine is improving dramatically, but then I look at charts like this one (click for bigger view):1\n\nAs promising as that data is, we don\u2019t seem to be getting too far with the 100+ thing. Even the most freak outliers don\u2019t crack 120. The human body seems programmed to shut itself down somewhere around the century mark, if it hasn\u2019t already. Clearly something other than the current type of healthcare advances will be needed to crack through the natural human lifespan ceiling\u2014it\u2019ll take some deeper recoding of the human genome.\nBut then the optimistic part of my brain imagines what it would be like to show George Washington around 2021 and watch him die of shock at how magical everything was, and it thinks about how the accelerating returns on progress mean that the world of 70- to 100-year-old me might be equally shocking to people today, and so it answers D) 150\u2013250.\nThe pessimistic part of my brain, looking at reality, makes a sad face and pats the optimistic part of my brain on the head.\nThe optimistic part of my brain, remembering how bad humans are at intuitively understanding exponential growth, pats the pessimistic part of my brain on the head.\n\n\n\nHow do you fall asleep? \u2013 Anastasia S. (Athens, Greece)\nWhen I can\u2019t fall asleep, it\u2019s either because my mind is caught in an anxious loop of some kind or my phone is keeping me up. The surefire fix to the anxious loop issue is to distract my mind with something else.\nBut what that something else is is important. If I start texting or scrolling around social media or brainstorming / researching for work or playing an addictive iPhone game, that\u2019ll just make me even less likely to sleep. Other activities, for whatever reason, seem to have the opposite effect and put me right to sleep. For me, what\u2019s effective is reading in the dark on a Kindle on dark mode, listening to a podcast or audiobook,6 doing a crossword puzzle on my phone, or as a last resort, YouTube videos, which work for the same reason it\u2019s so easy to fall asleep in front of the TV.\nThe problem with this is that most of these involve my phone, which also has all of those things that are great at keeping me up. Worse, when I wake up next to my phone, I inevitably start my day by getting sucked into inane phone stuff. This isn\u2019t just a time-waster\u2014the grown-up-ness with which I start my day usually sets the tone for the whole day. And the morning is often when some of the best insights pop up for me\u2014if they have space to pop up. The phone kills that space.\nSo I came up with a little scheme. Which brings me to:\n\n\n\nWhat is the best permanent lifestyle change you made in your life? \u2013 Elmar S. (Munich, Germany)\nI dug an old iPhone 6 out of my drawer (I had tried to trade it in but I botched something with the \u201cactivation lock\u201d whatever the hell that is and Apple sent it back to me) and this became my bed phone. No SIM card, not signed into iCloud, no apps except Kindle, iBooks, Downcast (podcasts), NYT Crosswords, YouTube, and some practical ones (alarm, calendar, notes and voice recorder for those morning insights). Then I leave my real phone in a different room, as far away and inconveniently located as possible. This has been pretty groundbreaking for me. I find that I actually look forward to saying bye to my normal phone and transitioning to the bed phone stage of the night. Bed phone still has worlds of fun in it\u2014just the healthy-for-night/morning kinds of fun.7\n\n\n\nDo you have an inner monologue? \u2013 Malaika D. (Groningen, The Netherlands)\nI actually wanna talk about this. I kind of think I don\u2019t have an inner monologue. I have certain moments when I\u2019m actually talking to myself in my head, but I find that 90% of the time my head is up in the clouds (which is most of the time) I have a lot of thoughts going on but no specific words in my head. I can\u2019t tell if that\u2019s what everyone is like or if I\u2019m weird. The reason I wonder about it is that when people explain why you should meditate, they say something like, \u201cit\u2019s important to quiet the constant \u2018chatter\u2019 in your head.\u201d And I always wonder whether \u201cchatter\u201d is just the word they\u2019re using for the constant stream of thoughts or if there is actually a voice to those thoughts in most people\u2019s head but not mine. Someone tell me what\u2019s up.\nAnyway I get your bigger point, Malaika, and I\u2019m with you, but I don\u2019t have a good answer beyond something obvious like \u201ctry meditation!\u201d So hopefully a commenter can tell us both how to fix ourselves.\n\n\n\nWhat really makes you angry? \u2013 Ingrid M.\n\nWhen I\u2019m late and a person in front of me is going really slowly at the cashier\nWhen I\u2019m late in an Uber and the driver makes a wrong turn\nWhen I\u2019m late at the airport with no margin for error and TSA decides it\u2019s the perfect time to search my bag and there are two other bags that need to be searched in front of mine and no one is searching any of the bags because the woman who searches bags is doing something else\nWhen I go to a Broadway show and look at the little slip of paper in the Playbill and the main character is replaced by an understudy\nWhen anyone needs me to do something that involves printing something\nBluetooth connectivity difficulties\nWhen I get a new bottle of liquid soap and I can\u2019t get the nozzle to pop up and instead it just spins around infuriatingly\nAny other kind of packaging that\u2019s hard to open\nWhen my packages get stolen from my shit-ass building lobby\nWhen I\u2019m sleeping somewhere either with no A/C or bad A/C and it\u2019s like 78\u00ba all night and I sleep 2 hours\nWhen some gem of a photo op presents itself with my dog or something on the street and my phone camera freezes on the blurred screen\nWhen I finally select the flight I want on Kayak and I\u2019m relieved I got a good price and I go to buy it and it takes me to the airline site where I fill everything out and click \u201cpurchase\u201d and it comes back with a message that says \u201cthe flight you\u2019ve selected is not available.\u201d\nWhen people disagree with me about politics and think they\u2019re right\nWhen I bought a tin of fancy salt and the fucking lid was impossible to get off and I finally got it to snap off and the salt went everywhere\nWhen I go to a site and select a menu item and the site finishes loading and the page jumps up just as I click and I select the wrong item and then I press back and select again and the same thing happens\nObscure name clues in crossword puzzles\nWhen my opponent opens up a huge spot in Words With Friends and my letters are awful\nWhen I\u2019m at a breakfast restaurant and ask for Tabasco Sauce and the waiter remembers to bring it 0 out of 100 times\nWhen I\u2019m watching something riveting on an airplane TV and the captain makes a long, drawn-out announcement\nWhen my tortoise shits on the floor while I\u2019m not in the room and then tramps through it and gets shit on every square inch of the apartment floor and 3 inches up every wall\nHow long it takes an iPhone to turn back on when you plug it back in after it dies\u00a0\nWhen I\u2019m watching a movie with someone and I\u2019ve seen it and they haven\u2019t and they talk or look at their phone during an important moment\nSandwiches or burgers with hard, thick bread\nWhen I\u2019m in the car with my sisters and they think it\u2019s an okay thing to blast their inane songs\nWhen an apartment building puts a sign up that says \u201cPlease keep noise down between 10pm and 7am\u201d because no one cares about late-night people (early riser privilege!)\nThe 99-year-old technology at my mom\u2019s house\nWebsites that won\u2019t let you go back \u2013 you just keep hitting the \u201cback\u201d button and it keeps refreshing the current page\nWhen I get delivery food that includes fries and instead of a little container of ketchup, they give me a bunch of tiny packets\nWhen I ask someone for the address where I\u2019m going and they tell me directions instead of just giving me the address to put in my phone\nWhen I go on vacation with people who want to wake up early and fill the day with icky activities\nJeans with button flies\n\n\n\n\nAre we bigger than we are small, or smaller than we are big? \u2013 Jarhead (Toronto, Canada)\nBiologically, we\u2019re definitely bigger than we are small. A typical blue whale is about 15 times the length of a human and around 2,500 times the mass. A human compared to microbes is many orders of magnitude larger. We\u2019re less big amongst mammals, but even there we\u2019re bigger than we are small. A human is about 35 times the length of the smallest mammal\u2014the adorable bumblebee bat\u2014and 40,000 times more massive.\nMoving beyond the realm of biology\u2014if we consider ourselves in relation to well-understood objects, we might make our endpoints a proton (10-16m) and the sun (108m), in which case we\u2019re much closer to the size of the sun than the size of a proton. Big again. But if we use the Milky Way (1020m) as our upper endpoint, then we become smaller than we are big.\nThen there\u2019s the whole range of size. According to my Universe in a Nutshell app (plug!), the smallest known unit of space, the Planck length (maybe our universe\u2019s pixel size), is about 10-35m. The largest space we can see is the observable universe, which is around 1026m range. If those are our endpoints, the midpoint between them would be a bit smaller than the width of a human hair\u2014making us bigger than we are small.\nBut the observable universe is probably only a tiny piece of the full universe, and then there\u2019s the multiverse if that\u2019s a thing. So the real upper endpoint is probably high enough, if it exists at all, to make us much smaller than we are big.\nMy takeaway here is that we\u2019re extremely middling when it comes to size, which I guess isn\u2019t the worst thing to be.\n\n\n\nHow do I get over a breakup if I\u2019m still in love? \u2013 Anon\nThere\u2019s no way to make an excruciating loss not excruciating except time, and I\u2019m sorry to hear about the excruciatingness you\u2019re going through.\nMaybe it\u2019ll help to remember that everyone you know, everyone you see on the street, everyone who\u2019s ever lived in every place and time, has probably been there too or will be there in the future\u2014because excruciating loss is an unfortunate staple of the human experience.\nIt might also help to remember that the part of you that feels like this wound will never heal is almost definitely wrong, and being wrong about that is also a staple of the human experience. Make that part of you write a letter to yourself, expressing how it feels. It\u2019ll be fun to read that letter later, when you\u2019re totally in love with someone new.\n\n\n\nWhen parking, if both options are available, do you pull into the spot or back in? \u2013 Brighid D. (Manchester, NH)\nPulling in forward is Present You living their best life and treating Future You like their assistant. Backing in is Present You acting like Future You\u2019s assistant. Pulling forward out of a spot you previously backed into is a highly luxurious experience, but as a procrastinator type whose jam it is to fuck over Future Tim, a rare one for me.\n\n\n\nWhat is the coolest magic trick that you\u2019ve seen? \u2013 Abhinav P. (Jaipur, Rajasthan, India)\nProfessional magic is by far the most underrated form of entertainment. Anytime I hear about a new magic show in NYC getting buzz, I buy tickets (magic over video can also be surprisingly great\u2014check out this incredible show).\nThe most inexplicable trick I\u2019ve seen was actually one where I happened to be the chosen subject from the audience. This guy (a \u201cmentalist\u201d not a magician whatever that means) had me go into my phone contacts and scroll and stop randomly somewhere and then remember where my finger was. It was on a friend named Lucy. He told me to put the phone away and concentrate on the name. He then told some fictional story and towards the end revealed that the main character\u2019s name was Lucy. There was no way he could see the phone at any point, and having held it close to me, I\u2019m almost sure no one behind me could see it either. Later in the night he correctly guessed my friend\u2019s ATM PIN number. Nothing he did was okay. I\u2019m upset just talking about this.\n\n\n\nWhy do you live in NYC? \u2013 Yertle T. (New York, NY)\nNYC is an extreme place. It\u2019s great at being exceptional and it\u2019s great at being awful. It\u2019s a high-priced filth bucket with great weather 25% of the time. It\u2019s supposedly this world-leading city and yet it\u2019s often behind the innovation curve and feels less futuristic than many other cities. The restaurants are world-class but it can also sometimes be hard to find a fresh salad for lunch. I could go on.\nBut it\u2019s also a place where within a 20-minute walk of my apartment I can find every cuisine in the world, every type of art, every kind of shop, and a million different cultural experiences (many in secret underground nooks). It feels like the entire world is crammed into this city.\nAmong US cities, it\u2019s not #1 for tech (SF), entertainment (LA), politics (DC), medicine (Boston), or a handful of other major industries. But it\u2019s at least top 5 in every industry. NYC has breadth like nowhere else I know (at least in the US). This is especially appealing to me since I like to dig into a lot of totally different areas with my writing.\nOn a me-specific level, it\u2019s a place where a large portion of my friends and acquaintances live, and of those who don\u2019t live here, a large portion come through the city at least once a year. Nowhere other than NYC would I be able to get this level of in-person contact with such a large percentage of people I care about. (It\u2019s also a quick trip to Boston, where much of my family lives.)\nFinally, I really like the historical aspect. 300 years of human ingenuity gives a place a lot of character (I know that sounds paltry to non-Americans but it\u2019s a big deal here!). Every street has an epic story to it. It makes the city like a big history museum to explore, and I like knowing that I\u2019ll never even scratch the surface.\nThe awful things about NYC suck. A lot. But for me at least, the good things make living here a clear net positive.\n\n\n\nHow are you? Just checking in. \u2013 Jake E. (Kristiansand, Norway)\nBesides the giant dark \u201cI gotta finish this book\u201d cloud hovering over my entire existence and preventing me from being present or content in any moment ever, great!\n\n\n\nWhat is the silliest thing you have placed on top of your tortoise? \u2013 Juan\nFor his 14th birthday, we threw a party for Winston and tied a string around his shell with a helium balloon attached. This was a great way to make sure no one stepped on him because the balloon was at eye level, like another guest at the party. Anyway he doesn\u2019t like parties so he moseyed his way into some little private cove, thinking no one would know where he was, not realizing there was a very obvious balloon giving him away.\n\n\n\nWhat should one do if a piece of media (book or movie or song) that holds some nostalgic value to you turns out to have been created by someone who\u2019s a \u2018bad\u2019 human being? \u2013 Anoushka D. (Delhi, India)\nI think in most cases, we should feel fine loving the art we love, regardless of who the artist is, what they did, or what they believed. John Lennon was physically abusive in his early relationships. Picasso and Jackson Pollock were abusive husbands. Walt Disney wasn\u2019t a fan of the Jews, nor is Cat Stevens. Ellen DeGeneres was a dick to her staff. Norman Mailer stabbed his wife. I could have listed 1,000 of these because artists are often messed up, unstable people who do or say bad things (and because most people secretly hold deep-down beliefs you would disapprove of if you knew about them). That a lot of great art emerges from troubled minds shouldn\u2019t be a surprise or invalidate the art as great art to be enjoyed\u2014at least not to me.\nIn many cases, we\u2019re also talking about artists who lived in different times\u2014times when your own ancestors who lived then almost certainly were doing or saying some things that would make them \u201cbad people\u201d by today\u2019s standards.\nFor those who generally agree with me about this, there might still be exceptions. Maybe an important part of why you liked The Cosby Show was the belief that Bill Cosby really was a lot like Cliff Huxtable, and knowing what you know now, the show loses its charm. I just find those to be the rare exceptions, not the rule.\nFinally, I would say there are two okay views to have here: 1) my view, that you can enjoy art by people you disapprove of, and 2) the opposite view, that not liking the artist ruins the art. What\u2019s not an okay view is 3) \u201cArt by a person I disapprove of should be banned so that no one is allowed to consume it, and any platform that doesn\u2019t ban it should be punished.\u201d There\u2019s way too much #3 going on right now.\n\n\n\nWhat countries were your absolute favorite travel experiences? \u2013\u00a0Samantha K. (Singapore)\nWhen I was 20, I took a solo backpacking trip to Thailand and China and became infatuated with traveling. Since then (covid notwithstanding), I\u2019ve tried to visit at least two new places every year. Here are some of my favorite travel experiences and best recommendations (most can be done on a backpacker\u2019s budget):\nTaking a commuter boat for three days down the Amazon from Belem to Manaus (Northern Brazil), sleeping in a mess of hammocks\u00a0and looking out at the little river communities\u00a0along the way.\nRiding the Trans-Siberian railway from Moscow to Krasnoyarsk, looking out the window, making friends with passengers, and seeing how the political views changed the further east we got (more on that trip here).\nDriving around desolate parts of Utah national parks, and sleeping every night outside the car on the edge of a canyon and waking up to the best view ever.\nStaying with a family who lives in a yurt\u00a0on the edge of the alpine Lake Song-Kul in Kyrgyzstan, spending the day in silence tagging along with the non-English-speaking shepherd\u00a0as he did his thing with the sheep up on the mountain, and watching their weekly horse race.\nDriving around Southern Italy and stopping for lunch in small walled villages\u00a0on the tops of hills and waving to window nonnas.\nThe Yangon New Year\u2019s Water Festival in Myanmar. Good god. We got invited onto the back of a truck with a bunch of locals, and the truck proceeded to drive around the city for five hours while we got absolutely wrecked by power hoses.\nDriving from Dubai to Southern UAE and camping out on the softest dunes ever.\nGoing to Gen Yamamoto\u2019s bar in Tokyo for six of the fanciest little cocktails imaginable (he\u2019s kind of the Jiro of cocktails) over two amazing hours.8 Also just the entire country of Japan in general.\nTaking a boat two hours from a small Greenlandic town to a 46-person village and doing a stay with the town grandmother. More on that trip here.\n\n\n\nHow can I become a higher-rung thinker? \u2013\u00a0Avery H. (Zeeland, MI)\n(If you don\u2019t know what \u201chigh-rung\u201d means, check out chapters 7 and 8 of The Story of Us.)\nTo borrow a Paul Graham suggestion, keep your identity small. High-rung thinking isn\u2019t some fancy thing. It\u2019s just being self-aware about what you know and what you don\u2019t know\u2014about staying close to the humility sweet spot.\n\nOne of the biggest impediments to this is when you start to identify with certain beliefs, stances, or ideologies. Once that happens, your Primitive Mind enters the equation and will do whatever possible to keep you from changing your mind, which cripples your ability to learn. Keeping your identity small is hugely liberating, and a lot less stressful. When your identity is small, you have nothing to cling onto and you can just relax and explore. So start by doing a self-audit and figuring out which ideas you\u2019ve come to hold sacred\u2014we all do this, it\u2019s human\u2014and remind yourself that they\u2019re just ideas, they\u2019re not you.\n\n\n\nWhat are your favorite podcasts? \u2013 Laura B. (Amsterdam, The Netherlands)\nCurrently hooked on Dan Carlin\u2019s Hardcore History. 100 people recommended it to me and I kept putting it off and finally listened to the 6-part WWI series and that was that for me. Went back to episode 1 and went through chronologically, currently up to episode 42 and loving every minute. History is so incredibly riveting if told by the right person, and Dan is the right person.\n\n\n\nWhat is your favorite form of transportation? \u2013\u00a0Sidhi (San Francisco, CA)\nWithout question the hoverboard. A few years ago, I was walking in NY and some guy passed by with one and I accosted him and asked him what the fuck that incredibly fun-looking thing was. He told me he actually sells them and gave me his info. A few days later I was the weird guy rolling around NY like a futuristic nerd, having the time of my life. I got really good at it and impressed lots of strangers and everything was great. Then, after a few weeks, the battery, though appearing to be half full, suddenly died and I wiped out in the middle of the street mortifyingly. I carried the board home and charged it up and pretended like nothing had happened and kept riding around. Then a few days later the battery died again out of nowhere and I wiped out mortifyingly in the street again. Turns out I had bought a cheap Chinese-made knockoff without realizing it. Bummer.\nI was gonna get a new one, this time online with some research and not from some shady fuck I met on the street\u2014but right around that time, NY decided it didn\u2019t know what a hoverboard was and didn\u2019t know how to categorize it or whether it should need a license or whether they should go in the bike lane or sidewalk and just shrugged and banned them. Disappointing all around.\nIf I time machined to 2040, one of the things I\u2019d hope to see would be lots of people traveling around on fun hands-free toys like that.\n\n\n\nHow do you feel about advertisements? Do they annoy you, or are you enticed about what they\u2019re trying to sell to you? \u2013\u00a0Fred M. (Chicago, IL)\nI love targeted ads, when the AI is good enough. The problem with targeted ads is normally they\u2019re not really good at targeting, so they\u2019re useless and annoying. But Instagram has gotten pretty good at it and now I own a gravity blanket, a moon pod, stretchy jeans, a great hoodie, and like 19 fidget\u00a0toys and physics\u00a0toys and other stupid things that make me happy. Buying dumb shit you like is a good thing to do because you\u2019re supporting small businesses (this is the story I tell myself), and effective targeted ads connect supply and demand in an optimal, nuanced way. I hope down the road the targeting gets so good that ads will pop up and be like \u201cyour dad\u2019s birthday is coming up, here are five great options for him that we know he wants\u2014click your favorite and it\u2019ll arrive to him, gift-wrapped, on his birthday!\u201d\nI know I\u2019m supposed to feel the opposite way about all of this because it\u2019s creepy and non-privacy-y, but I\u2019m gonna be dead at some point for trillions of years so who cares if big companies are manipulating my simple psychology for profit, if it brings me joy?\n\n\n\nIf you were forced to live in a country outside of the top 50 for 5 years, which country would it be and why? \u2013 Dom W. (New York, NY)\nIf you ask me when I\u2019m feeling energetic and ambitious, I\u2019d say Nigeria. After visiting there in 2014, I came away feeling excited. With over 200 million people, it\u2019s the 6th-most populous nation, and Lagos is a massive metropolis bustling with energy\u2014somewhere I wouldn\u2019t get bored and where I could find lots of outlets for my own projects.\nBut Nigeria would also be a hectic choice, and a hard place to live at times, so if you ask me when I\u2019m tired, it would probably seem a bit \u201cmuch\u201d for a five year stint. In that mood, I\u2019d choose Laos. Never been, but it looks insanely beautiful and the food would make me happy.\n\n\n\nWhat is the best piece of advice you have ever received? \u2013 Laura H. (New York, NY)\nI met Chris Anderson, the head of TED, in 2015. He had read a few WBW posts and offered me the opportunity to give a TED Talk at the 2016 conference (which was six months away). Immediately full of both gratitude/excitement and dread/anxiety, I asked him if it might be better to wait a couple years until I had some more speaking experience. He paused thoughtfully for a few seconds before saying, \u201cThere\u2019s no time like the present.\u201d I took his advice. Since then, his voice saying those words has popped into my head again and again during hard decisions, and I\u2019m yet to regret following them.\nGreat advice is sometimes great because it\u2019s totally original or framed in an original way. But, as in my story, a well-known platitude, at the perfect moment, can also make a huge impact. What makes Chris\u2019s advice so valuable to me wasn\u2019t that it was something new\u2014it was that the lesson I learned from taking the advice in that particular moment turned a clich\u00e9 into a mantra.\n\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts on TikTok? \u2013 Annie (Ontario, California)\nFor a long time, TikTok was this impossibly annoying-seeming thing that wouldn\u2019t go away. Then my friend Isabelle started posting pro-nuclear-energy videos on TikTok, so I finally got the app to watch them. Then I got sucked in.\nThe thing is, the TikTok algorithm is really good. It knows me better than I know myself. I don\u2019t follow any accounts on TikTok, I just go to the \u201cFor You\u201d tab and start scrolling down the video stream TikTok has prepared for me, and the curation quality is strong.\nSometimes there\u00a0are\u00a0people\u00a0being\u00a0funny. Sometimes there\u00a0are\u00a0people\u00a0doing\u00a0pranks. There\u2019s George and Hector and this squirrel and this drunk chicken and the bees lady. And then there are the trolls. People trolling their boyfriends and girlfriends and husbands and wives and cats and dogs and\u00a0babies and teachers and customers. And a\u00a0lot\u00a0of\u00a0people\u00a0trolling\u00a0their\u00a0parents. TikTok isn\u2019t for everyone. But it is for me.\nI\u2019ve now created a fun activity, where I \u201cfavorite\u201d the best videos during a scroll and at some point beam my phone up to the TV to show my wife the favorites. Highly recommend this activity.\n\n\n\nAre you a tabletop gamer? \u2013 Ryan M. (Odessa, TX)\nOf the staples, I love Scrabble and have played like 1,000 games of Words With Friends (which has in turn fucked up my Scrabble game). I have periodic chess phases, though they never last long enough for me to become not bad (my chess.com rating peaked in the 900s during my last bout).\nMy sister is always upsettingly pushing new games on me, which I first resist and then become addicted to. Recently, she\u2019s gotten me into Coup and Codenames (both delightful). I\u2019ve dipped my toe into the Polytopia wormhole and am scared about the possibilities. Not a tabletop game, but a consistent winner with groups is what my friends and I call the Name Game (variations are called Celebrity or Fishbowl)\u2014rules in this footnote.9\n\n\n\nWhat supplements or multivitamins do you take? \u2013 Stacey W. (Perth, Australia)\nI usually take some kind of one-a-day multivitamin that I deep down believe does nothing but I take it just in case. And a spoonful of Metamucil every morning so I can be happy.\nAnd then I like to experiment with work/productivity supplements. I\u2019ve recently been trying a combination of gingko biloba and lion\u2019s mane supplements. I\u2019ve also been trying out Qualia Mind, made by Flow Genome Project, but just started so no verdict yet. Always open to suggestions, so let me know if you use anything that works well for you!\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s a recent embarrassing and/or interesting rabbit hole you\u2019ve found yourself going down semi-unintentionally? \u2013 Jace L. (Tulare, CA)\nI have a love-hate relationship with YouTube. Love the videos, hate myself. The problem is, YouTube spirals happen for me almost exclusively when I\u2019m in the Dark Playground\u2014that place you\u2019re in when you should be working but you\u2019re not working. Either someone sends me a YouTube link or I go there for genuine research purposes\u2014and then the algorithm pulls me into the pit.\nSome of these pits are at least productive, when\u00a0I\u2019m\u00a0learning\u00a0something\u00a0about\u00a0science\u00a0or\u00a0history. Others at least are\u00a0high\u00a0quality\u00a0art\u00a0or\u00a0comedy\u00a0or\u00a0something\u00a0else\u00a0interesting.\nBut then there are the dark moments. When nothing good at all is happening. In order to answer Jace\u2019s question, I decided to play a dangerous game: lifting off the hood of my YouTube history and seeing, staring me in the face, all the places I\u2019ve been. Some of the more disturbing finds from the past few years (each spiral goes up chronologically, with the first video I watched at the bottom):\nHere\u2019s a typical run:\n\nAlso typical:\n\nOne day, I spent a lot of time with this man while he hurt himself:\n\nThis day started with string quartet covers before things got Jewy:\n\nSorry not sorry:\n\nWho needs to work when you have Hitler!\n\nNeeded a drink at the end of this:\n\nThe Bushmen and the Pygmies are my friends and not yours:\n\nNot sure what happened here:\n\nNo regrets:\n\nNot proud of this:\n\nCan\u2019t explain this:\n\nNot useful:\n\nPossibly the strangest sequence I found:\n\n\n\n\nWould you rather\u00a0be 11 feet tall or nine inches tall? \u2013 Alexander R. (Windhoek, Namibia)\nSurprisingly hard one. 11 feet seems like the obvious answer. You\u2019re a full \u201cthing\u201d everywhere you go and everyone would flip out, but then they\u2019d get used to it and you could still have an almost normal life. You could still have an almost normal house. You could for sure play in the NBA. You could still have sex.\nNo one is fucking a nine-inch tall person. And you couldn\u2019t go anywhere without everyone you\u2019re about to see being fully prepped ahead of time for the situation. Your house would be a joke. That said, there would be benefits. You could sneak into anything and hide very easily. Like you could probably smuggle yourself on a plane to Russia without anyone noticing, sneak into the Kremlin, and listen in on the most secretive Putin meetings while hiding behind the curtains or somewhere. But then what?\nSo I guess my answer is that the nine-inch-tall option would be very fun for a while but then when you got bored of the perks, you\u2019d be confronted with your life as a pencil person and would probably regret the choice. So I\u2019d go with 11 feet tall.\n\n\n\nCan you suggest methods for dealing with the crushing realization that people you used to have a lot of respect for don\u2019t hold the principles/values you thought they did and therefore might no longer be worthy of your respect? Especially close people like parents, teachers, mentors, and religious leaders? \u2013 JD I. (Charleston, SC)\nI find this to be a pretty reliable graph:\n\nThe better I get to know people I\u2019ve previously demonized, the more pleasantly surprised I am. The better I get to know people I\u2019ve previously lionized, the more disappointed I become. This makes sense, because people are neither demons nor angels\u2014they\u2019re humans. The crushing realization you\u2019re experiencing is probably less some awful truths you\u2019re learning about people you admire and more a truth you\u2019re seeing about humans in general. Even the people you look up to are fallible and flawed\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t also be worthy of your love and respect.\nWith all that in mind, I\u2019d consider three things:\nFirst, take a hard look at ways you feel these people are disappointing you, and try asking whether your own judgments might be off. On more than one occasion, I\u2019ve scoffed at those I once considered wise only to later realize that they weren\u2019t all that wrong after all.\nSecond, think about all the ways a human can be good and wise, and you\u2019ll be reminded of certain ways these people are still very much worthy of your admiration. Focusing on those areas can restore the respect you want to feel towards them.\nFinally, where you do firmly believe you have something right that they don\u2019t, remember that wisdom is a multi-generational collaboration. When mentorship works, it raises mentees to be wiser than the mentor\u2014mentees who can then be even better mentors to the next generation. This is how the wisdom trend slopes continually upwards. If your mentors are forever wiser than you, they failed as mentors. So when you do feel wiser, it\u2019s not a bad thing\u2014it means it\u2019s your turn to take the wisdom torch and try to bring it to the next level.\n\n\n\nWhat are your most left-wing, and most right-wing, political positions? \u2013 Hannah J. (London, UK)\nAt the moment I\u2019m feeling progressive about the legalization of drugs and sex work (in both cases, the black markets that result from illegality seem to cause more harm than the thing itself), and conservative about wanting the government to be smaller (bigger government seems to correlate with both less competence and more corruption).\n\n\n\nDo you plan to write updates for the AI and SpaceX posts? \u2013\u00a0Matt J. (Sartell, MN)\nYes and yes. SpaceX first.\n\n\n\nWhat conspiracy theory do you think is most probably true? \u2013 Maja (Ottawa, Canada)\nOne that I\u2019ve been considering (only a hunch, no actual info) is that big alcohol companies (Anheuser-Busch, etc.) are the new big tobacco companies (Philip Morris, etc.). And instead of trying to suppress evidence that cigarettes are disastrous for your health, the big alcohol companies need to keep all the other fun drugs stigmatized and illegal\u2014and with tens of billions of dollars at stake, they\u2019ll spend billions of dollars to keep the status quo the way it is.\nWhen I grew up, the rules were clear: if a party is a cool party, it has alcohol at it, and if you\u2019re a cool person, you drink alcohol. If your party doesn\u2019t have alcohol, it\u2019s not a cool party, and if you don\u2019t drink alcohol, you\u2019re not a cool person. If you take a step back and think about it, that\u2019s kinda weird. This one particular drug, of so many, has been deemed A) the socially acceptable, non-stigmatized one, and B) the definition of cool. Meanwhile, alcohol is just an alright drug\u2014probably a below average one\u2014while also being one of the most dangerous and harmful ones. It makes no sense\u2014until you remember that cigarettes made no sense either\u2026\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s your best advice for someone moving to NYC? \u2013 Tessa C. (Kansas City, MO; living in Dublin, Ireland; moving to New York, NY)\nGet rid of your stuff (or store it somewhere) unless you really love it. Small apartments can be cozy and great if you don\u2019t have too much stuff.\nDo all the touristy things (Statue of Liberty, etc.) while you\u2019re still in the honeymoon phase, because if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll never do them.\nLook up a list of the best pizza places in the city and go to one a month until you\u2019ve tried them all. Lucali and Paulie Gee\u2019s are my top recs.\nLook up lists like this and actually do the things. Nowhere has more amazing secret spots than NYC.\n\n\n\nWhy the King of Spades?\u00a0And are his eyes always looking up that way? \u2013 Hector F. (San Antonio, TX)\nWhen I was tossing around potential names for the site, \u201cMiniature King\u201d was in the running. At least to me it was, before it was promptly vetoed by my wife / then girlfriend. But in the process, I had become attached to the visual I had in mind\u2014something with a very small, very tyrannical king who was outraged about being the non-consensual mascot of a random blog. So when it was time to design the eventual site, I stuck with the king as the mascot. He\u2019s looking up because he\u2019s rolling his eyes at the concept of being the WBW mascot and because he\u2019s upset about the little men that are marching up onto his head, which is not a very dignified thing to be happening to a great tyrant king.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s a view/opinion you were holding for a long time but changed recently (let\u2019s say in the last few years)? \u2013 Mike L. (Singapore)\nReligion being a generally bad thing overall. Obviously religion can be, and often is, a bad thing that does more harm than good. But what\u2019s become more clear to me is that we\u2019re a religious species, period, and while today\u2019s prominent religions are certainly flawed, the political religions of history or today are often even worse.\nIt just doesn\u2019t seem like we\u2019re a species that\u2019s ready for widespread atheism quite yet. Until things change, traditional religions are probably more helpful than they are harmful. Still thinking about this one.\n\n\n\nHow do you balance reading the news/staying up to date on current events with avoiding burnout and the feeling that everything is terrible all the time and nothing you do matters so why bother? \u2013 Fenway D. (Greensboro, NC)\nA lot of what used to be news has morphed into propaganda, and there\u2019s no shame in ignoring propaganda. The really big stuff will filter its way to you no matter what you do.\nIf you do want to keep up with the news, it also doesn\u2019t have to happen directly, via the media. Listening regularly to a few good interview-style podcasts, for example, can be a great way to get a feel for the big issues going on in a more indirect way.\nAs far as feeling like nothing you do matters, I actually think that\u2019s an intuitive but incorrect assumption. In a moment when so many people are afraid to express their real views in public, doing so can make a real difference.\n\n\n\nYou often mention being inspired and challenged by interesting conversations. How have you increased the proportion and/or frequency of these conversations in your life? \u2013 Andrew N. (London, UK)\nOne thing that can go a long way: see the people you really like talking to more frequently. This is about more than the obvious point that doing so literally increases the cumulative time you\u2019ll talk to them: When you don\u2019t see someone frequently enough, every time you do hang out ends up being a big catch-up, where both of you update the other on your lives. This doesn\u2019t seem like a problem until you consider that the whole relationship now mostly consists of catching each other up (and reminiscing about old times because you\u2019re not making any new times together). This isn\u2019t actually hanging out. Hanging out means shooting the shit about whatever\u2019s on your mind and exploring new topics together. If I haven\u2019t seen someone in forever and then they\u2019re in town for a week and I see them twice, it\u2019s the second hangout, with the catch-up out of the way, where the more interesting conversation usually happens.10\nTwo friends and I started zoom-chatting every Friday during covid and it just turned into a thing that now happens once a week, and the conversations are great because they\u2019re free of big-picture catch-up\u2014they\u2019re either about ongoing keeping up, or more often, just fun divergent conversation about third-party topics. If you have anyone you like talking to enough to do it a few times every month, try to make that happen.\n\n\n\nDo you have some tips of where and/or how to meet people who tend to think more high-rung, both online and in real life? Or is it more about recognizing them scattered throughout our lives? \u2013 Steven D. (Zavantem, Brussels, Belgium)\nWhere\u2019s the entrance to the idea labs? I\u2019m a teenager and right now I\u2019m trying to accumulate knowledge and skills as much as I can. There are quite a few people who inspire me and they all seem to be in a network of other smart/amazing people. The question is \u2013 how do you find other people who want to grow and exchange knowledge? \u2013 Mikhail I. (Moscow, Russia)\nThree ideas:\n1) Mine people you already know for hidden high-rung-ness. Sometimes two people get stuck in a dynamic where both feel like they have to agree with each other, which is kind of boring and stressful and makes it hard to dig deep and explore anything\u2014but neither one actually prefers it to be this way. They\u2019re just stuck in a social rut. In this case, all it might take is one person actually starting to say what they really think and being willing to break the \u201cdisagreement\u201d ice, and the whole relationship can transform into something much more interesting and high rung. Of course, there are plenty of other times when an Echo Chamber dynamic is in place because one or both people very much want it to be that way, and an attempt by one party to snap out of that will go over badly (btw, this isn\u2019t the end of the world\u2014it just means that high-rung conversation won\u2019t be a part of that relationship, you can still enjoy the rest of what it has to offer). If you do find that most of your existing relationships are stuck on the intellectual low rungs, you\u2019ll want to supplement things with some new friendships that can better indulge your intellect. This is where the other two points come in.\n2) Collect high-rungers you happen upon in the wild. Post-college-age people tend to be really bad at making new friends. But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. There will be moments\u2014at work, at a dinner party, at some event\u2014when you discover a super interesting-seeming person you really like talking to, and you wish you were friends with them. If you feel this way, there\u2019s a decent chance they feel the same way about you. And if you can fight off your mammoth (who is irrationally horrified by the possibility you may put yourself out there and get rejected) and get in the habit of getting their phone number and sending a \u201cgreat meeting you! would love to chat again sometime\u201d text\u2014and then if the response is positive, actually scheduling a coffee or lunch or drink (mammoth: \u201cbut what if they were just being polite!\u201d), over time you\u2019ll accumulate a whole new basket of high-rung brains to play with.11 It\u2019s really easy to just not put yourself out there for new friendships as an adult, but those who do are usually rewarded.\n3) Actively go out looking for high-rungers. This is the ickiest, most amorphous item, and I don\u2019t have specific suggestions beyond: put yourself in high-rung environments whenever possible. That can mean the place you live, the place you work, the places you spend your free time, the forums you hang out in online, the events you go to. Speaking of which\u2014\n\n\n\nDo you plan to have another Wait But Hi?\u2013\u00a0Fausto L. (Madrid, Spain)\u2013\u00a0Mini (Perth, Australia)\u2013\u00a0Sam W. (Raleigh, NC)\u2013\u00a0Barbara P. (Budapest, Hungary)\u2013\u00a0Kelvin J. (Turku, Finland)\u2013\u00a0Chelsea I. (Perth, Australia)\nYes, definitely. Like everything Wait But Why, this has been on hold because of the Story of Us albatross, but the answer is yes. We consider \u201cWait But Hi\u201d to be not a single event, or even a single type of event, but the \u201cin-person\u201d category of Wait But Why. The first Wait But Hi centered around a hypothesis that people who read WBW would probably like meeting other people who read WBW, and the event confirmed it. Alicia, Andrew, and I have had many brainstorms about other creative WBH formats, so stay tuned.\n\n\n\nWhat animal would you shrink down to pocket size (or the size of a coke can) to keep as a pet? \u2013 Tandice U. (New York, NY)\nElephant.\nMost other animals already have a mini version (a small tiger or lion is basically a kitten, small alligator is a gecko, small buffalo is like half the weird little dogs I see on the street). But there\u2019s nothing like a small elephant. Plus they\u2019re usually so big so it\u2019s extra funny. Plus they\u2019re smart and have great personalities. And they live like 80 years. The ideal miniature pet.\n\n\n\nWho is your favorite Tim? \u2013 Tim (Auckland, New Zealand)\nTim Berners-Lee\nRunner-up: Tim Duncan\n\n\n\nIf you had power to dictate what should be taught in schools\u2014things that everyone had to master before they get to enter adulthood\u2014what would you add to the curriculum? \u2013 Audrey T. (Toronto, Canada)\nGeneral (should be part of many classes):\n\nIndependent, first-principles thinking\nHow to argue and debate productively\nHow to be an effective learner\nIntellectual humility\nIndependent problem-solving skills, through practice\n\nSubject-specific:\n\nBasic math\nBasic science, and more importantly, a lot of practice with the scientific method\nBasic civics\nBasic money management\nEnough writing and speaking skills to be an effective communicator\nEnough history to understand why fundamental liberal rights were invented and how precious they are\nOlder students should be able to go deeper in the areas they feel most drawn to or, if resources allow, take electives where they can learn a more specific skill\nIndoctrination in the teacher\u2019s particular political ideology\nOh wait definitely not that last one\n\n\n\n\nI just started a new relationship. How do I not fuck it up and/or how do I make love stay? \u2013 Robert B. (Denver, CO)\nA general suggestion: Have your mantra be \u201cI\u2019m gonna show them exactly who I really am and if it turns out they don\u2019t like it, they\u2019re not the right person for me anyway.\u201d Takes all the pressure off.\nA specific suggestion: Plan fun, creative, exciting \u201cmystery dates\u201d and refuse to tell them what the plan is until they get there. A mystery date can be any kind of experience or activity\u2014just something outside the box.\n\n\n\nDo you think, overall, covid accelerated progress of the human colossus or slowed down progress of the human colossus? \u2013 Sean M. (New Orleans, LA)\nDesperate times call for desperate measures and desperate measures have a knack for wildly accelerating progress and innovation. At least in the modern era, this phenomenon usually outweighs the destruction and lost time caused by desperate times. The classic example would be World War II, which is why we have the computer, the nuclear weapon, and the moon landing\u2014or at least why we got those things as quickly as we did.\nCovid certainly slowed down progress in some ways\u2014but a ton of learning and innovation happened in the past year that may have set us way forward in some very important areas. The average person in 1945 knew that the war had advanced certain technologies, but few could have foreseen the amazing ways those advances would be applied in the decades to come. If something like mRNA technology has just taken a major leap forward, the people of 2050 might have covid to thank for some of their most groundbreaking biotech.\n\n\n\nAre you optimistic about the future of the United States? \u2013 Stephanie W. (Washington, D.C.)\nAll signs point to \u201cno\u201d. But American history is full of moments when all signs pointed to no. So yes?\n\n\n\nWhat do you hope Gen Z does with the world? \u2013 Anne Z. (Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada)\nMakes political tribalism a lame thing for lame old people.\n\n\n\nIf you were an omnipotent god for 24 hours, what would you do?\u00a0After the 24 hours, you\u2019d turn back into your regular self but still remember that day. \u2013 Lena S. (Munich, Germany)\n\u201cOmnipotent god\u201d is a very legit amount of power. Here\u2019s what I\u2019d do:\nRestore the level of carbon in the carbon cycle to 1850 levels and invent some insanely powerful and efficient, cheap-to-make, totally safe nuclear fusion reactor that you could fuel with garbage like the Delorean in Back to the Future 2, and put instructions for how to make it online.\nRandomly select a color from the Pantone deck and make all human skin that color.\nInvent an easy, cheap way to make succulent lab-grown meat and put the instructions online.\nMake the U.S. government a parliamentary system.\nLearn the deal with the Fermi Paradox.\nLearn the deal with dark matter.\nTribalism out. Teleportation in.\nTweak the human body so that Oreos and Chinese food are both perfect health food.\nAll couches are forever incredibly comfortable and like an L-couch except the long part of the L extends across the whole couch, so it\u2019s like a king bed.\nAll internet is free and fast forever.\nAll human brains are on a mild dose of MDMA at all times.\nTerraform Mars to Earth-like perfection with a snap of my omnipotent fingers. Make a few backup copies of Elon that activate one by one if he dies or gets bored. Incept the idea in Elon\u2019s head that Tim Urban absolutely must be on the first voyage to Mars but not to do any icky work, just to blog about the experience.\nPerfect anti-aging technology so everyone can revert their body to any age they prefer and stay there until they\u2019re bored enough of living they\u2019re ready to die. Put instructions for the technology I used to make Elon backups online so everyone can make backups of themselves in case they die in an accident. Use my omnipotence to ensure that all backups are in fact still \u201cyou.\u201d All backups are constantly updated to mirror the main version, and only one can be activated one at a time.\nAll sentences in articles or tweets that are untrue automatically appear in red block letters.\nMy book is done and everyone agrees it\u2019s just \u201ca really good point.\u201d\nMy dog is perfectly trained, no longer needs to eat or drink or pee or shit, bathes herself once a week, lives forever, and can be switched off when we go on vacation.\nAll my shrunk t-shirts are unshrunk and permanently unshrinkable.\nThere\u2019s a Dan Carlin episode for everything that\u2019s ever happened and Hamilton goes all the way through to today, instead of stopping in like 1802.\nRainbows are climbable and slidable. Clouds are jumpable.\nAll ocean and pool water is 95 degrees F. All hot tubs 104.\nPaper straws are banned, plastic straws are back.\nTweak the human body so exercise makes you fat and depressed and stagnation makes you fit and happy.\nCreate a benevolent superintelligent AI that \u201cjust gets it.\u201d This AI ensures that all future AI is friendly and that no one is too big of a dick. The AI is also in charge of making sure that none of my new rules or inventions backfires in unexpected ways.\n\n\n\nWho is your dog? \u2013 Tim Urban (New York, NY)\nGlad you asked!\n\n\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Elon\u2019s controversial side? \u2013 Ekin K. (Izmir, Turkey)\nIt emerges from the same quality that invents new things, challenges conventions, and changes the world: extreme originality, whether people like it or not. So I\u2019m all for it.\n\n\n\nHow was Burning Man? \u2013 Zenon S. (Columbus, MI)\nRoughly 100X cooler and more fun than I had expected.\n\n\n\nWhy hasn\u2019t anyone created something between a cat and a dog? What would it be called? \u2013 Leo L. (London, UK)\n\n\n\n\nHow has writing Story of Us changed you personally? \u2013 Ankit L. (Pune, India)\nWriting the Story of Us\u2014first as a series and now as a book\u2014has totally reshaped the way I think. The core mental model in the book has become a lens I use constantly. I\u2019ve also learned a lot about politics, history, psychology, and sociology that I didn\u2019t know before. My goal with the book is to take the most important parts of both the framework and the things I\u2019ve learned and package it in a way that can resonate with many different kinds of minds and actually stick. I want people who read the book to feel 20 years from now like it still impacts the way they think.\nThere were lots of mailbag questions about both the series and the book, but given that every month, as I get closer to the finish line, what the best plan is seems to shift, I\u2019ll leave it at that big-picture point for now.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite thing that has come about because of something you\u2019ve written? \u2013 Laura D. (Hampshire, UK)\nSeveral people have told me that they moved closer to their family after reading The Tail End. That\u2019s a big deal!\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve been a Patreon for like 4 years now. But now that you will be releasing a book, will you still need my support? What are your plans for the future? \u2013 Kyros J.(Barcelona, Spain)\nHere\u2019s how I think about Patreon, from our side:\nPatreon is a means of creative freedom. Without Patreon, money would be a sizable part of our decision-making process. We\u2019d have to take on sponsorships, sell products, and use paywalls, whether we felt good about it or not. Patreon allows us to do whatever we think actually makes sense for us and what we\u2019re trying to do. It allows us to make a big list of potential projects and to prioritize them based on what we\u2019re most excited about and what we think is the most important, not based on what will make the most money. Patreon means that we\u2019ll do some projects that make money and others that won\u2019t, and we don\u2019t have to worry too much about which ones are which. It allows us to start a podcast without a sponsor and have the \u201cwe\u2019ll get a sponsor if and when it feels right\u201d attitude. It allows us to turn the Story of Us into a book, because it makes sense in this case, and to have turned down opportunities to make other post series into books, because it wasn\u2019t something we felt made sense. It allows us to email readers about a product in our store only when we\u2019re actually excited to tell them about that product. Having money as a secondary concern is an unbelievable creative luxury and one that makes Wait But Why a better place.\nHere\u2019s how I think about Patreon, from your side:\nThe independent internet creator is a pretty new kind of thing, and I think we\u2019re all still figuring out the best ways for that to work, financially. Patreon gives regular readers three options:\n1) I like this person\u2019s work, and I\u2019d like to pay something for it\n2) I like this person\u2019s work, and I\u2019d like to pay something for it, but right now I can\u2019t afford to\n3) I like this person\u2019s work, but it\u2019s not something I want to pay for\nThe great thing about having a sizable audience is that if a small portion of our readers end up in Category 1, we\u2019re covered. So far, that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened. Category 1 readers have combined to be an incredibly important support for us and provide that treasured creative freedom I talked about.\nBut that also means that we\u2019re totally cool with Categories 2 and 3.\nPeople in Category 2, who would like to support us but don\u2019t have the budget to spare: not only is that okay, but please know that the last thing I want is for WBW support to be an uncomfortable or stressful expense in your life. I love the idea of WBW being free for people who are only able to consume free content at a given time in their lives.\nPeople in Category 3, who simply prefer to put their dollars towards other causes, please continue doing so. This is the cool thing about the voluntary donation model\u2014only some people have to do it for it to work perfectly. Category 1 has everyone else covered.\nIf you\u2019ve been a Category 1 supporter of ours, huge hug, we love you, and we\u2019re endlessly grateful. You should also never feel weird or guilty about stopping. Supporting us doesn\u2019t have to mean supporting us forever. Once a Category 1er, always a Category 1er, no matter when you stop.\nFinally, Patreon is only one way to support WBW. There\u2019s also buying stuff we sell and, probably most important, sharing WBW with others.\nAs for the future of Wait But Why:\nAt the moment, it\u2019s hard to imagine a time when I will want to be doing anything other than creating new things on this platform. My \u201cfuture topics list\u201d is longer than I could ever get through in one life, and as long as I\u2019m curious, I\u2019ll be working my way through it.\nWithin that broader picture, there are a ton of fun possibilities. We plan to expand the platform from just writing to writing, audio, and video. We want to keep trying new things and new collaborations (like the app we made with Kurzgesagt). We want to dig in deeper with the community with more in-person events. We\u2019ve sketched out plans for a new, much better site.\nIt\u2019s been a slow few years as I\u2019ve worked on a single, big project, but my excitement and energy have never been higher. I hope I\u2019m still making good things when I\u2019m 80 and I hope you\u2019re still here with me.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nIf you like Wait But Why, sign up for our unannoying-I-promise email list\u00a0and we\u2019ll send you new posts when they come out.\nTo support Wait But Why,\u00a0visit our Patreon page.\nFor my daily musings, follow WBW on Twitter and Instagram.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nOther places to go:\nMailbag #1\nThe Travel Series\nThe Procrastination Matrix\n\n\nDepending on how transparent viruses are, we might need to stack a bunch of these virus squares to make it opaque enough to see, which would raise the total number of viruses needed into the millions or even billions.\u21a9The NIH does note that most of the human cells are red blood cells (a further rabbit hole reminded me that red blood cells look like delicious gummy candy), and they admit that red blood cells are kind of just \u201cbags full of hemoglobin.\u201d If you only count human cells with a nucleus, the ratio is 10 bacteria for every human cell.\u21a9Zachary got more than he bargained for here.\u21a9As a one-time budding film composer, it used to be stressful playing the score I had written for the director the first time. They had inevitably become attached to their stupid temp score (the existing film scores directors put into the film before handing it over to the composer to write the original music) and were hearing mine for the first time, so they\u2019d predictably (infuriatingly!) not like it on the first listen. I\u2019d play it for them a few times and the next day, they\u2019d listen again and usually would suddenly like it. Film scoring is annoying.\u21a9Every time I call her, Nana asks me when my book will be done, and her new thing is telling me now that I\u2019ll be very regretful if she dies before she gets to put it on her coffee table\u2014thanks Nana!\u21a9If you sleep in a bed with someone else, you probably can\u2019t just listen out loud to stuff without bothering them. A single AirPod solves the problem for me\u2014and you can just take it out when you\u2019re drifting off and that pauses the podcast (or video).\u21a9A more austere version of this is just having books or a Kindle in the bedroom and phone elsewhere. But I like the variety the bed phone gives me.\u21a9Email [email\u00a0protected] to make a reservation, at least a month before you\u2019ll be in Tokyo.\u21a9Minimum four people, max 15 or even a little higher. Two teams, everyone writes down names on little slips of paper, folds them and puts them into a big communal bowl (one name on each slip), and each team also has their own empty bowl. You want about 40 names total, so if it\u2019s a 2-on-2 game, everyone should put 10 names in the bowl each. If it\u2019s 5-on-5, everyone should do four names. Names can be celebrities, friends of the people playing, or famous fictional characters\u2014you can go a little obscure but you want at least half of the group to know each name. There are three rounds. In the first round, Person 1 on Team A starts \u2013 they have one minute \u2013 they pick a name out of the bowl and say whatever they want (other than stupid cheats like saying \u2018the name rhymes with Ill Pinton!\u2019 and no doing impressions or pointing at anything \u2013 just verbal description) \u2013 when one of their teammates successfully calls out the name, they put the piece of paper into their team\u2019s bowl and pick the next name. After a minute their turn is up and the name in their hand goes back into the big bowl. Teams alternate and who the name-picker is on each team alternates with each turn. When all the names are out, Round 1 is over. Names in each team\u2019s bowl are tallied up and the score is written down. Then all the names go back into the big bowl. Round 2 is the same as round 1 except the name-picker can only say one word now. No facial expressions or anything. One word and then they have to go blank and hope it\u2019s enough for their team to get it. Round 3 is like the other 2 rounds except no words now \u2013 just silent acting. Usually that\u2019s the end but if you wanna get weird, bonus round 4 is the same as round 3 except the name-picker now has a bed sheet over their entire head and body, like a kid in a ghost costume. The team with the highest cumulative score in the 3 (or 4) rounds wins. Only other rule is that if in round 1, the name-picker doesn\u2019t know the name, they can\u2019t pass, so they can try to get it using other tricks \u201cfirst name is the same name as the first U.S. president, etc.\u201d or they can challenge. When a player challenges, the timer stops, they say the name, and whoever knows who that person is raises their hand. If fewer than half the other players know the name, the name-picker counts the name as a point and it goes into their team\u2019s bowl, the timer is started where it left off, and the turn continues. If half or more of the people know the name, the other team gets that name in their bowl and the player\u2019s turn then continues. Those who don\u2019t know the name need to learn it then because in future rounds there are no challenges.\u21a9It\u2019s always an option to just skip the big catch-up with friends you don\u2019t see very often, but that\u2019s not great either because it\u2019s hard to be close when you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with someone.\u21a9A less risky option if your mammoth is flipping out is to invite the person to a gathering you\u2019re organizing.\u21a9Our World in Data\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAbout Tim

For information on the previous deprecation of Google+ for users with personal Google accounts, please see this post.\u00a0What's ChangingLast year, we announced plans to wind down Currents, to focus efforts on community experiences that are better integrated with the rest of Google Workspace. To help our customers manage this transition, we published detailed guidance for Workspace administrators and enabled customers to opt-in for automated migration of Currents data to spaces in Google Chat.\u00a0We are nearing the end of this transition. Beginning July 5, 2023, Currents will no longer be available. Workspace administrators can export Currents data using Takeout before August 8, 2023. Beginning August 8th, Currents data will no longer be available for download.\u00a0Although we are saying goodbye to Currents, we continue to invest in new features for Google Chat, so teams can connect and collaborate with a shared sense of belonging. Over the last year, we've delivered features designed to support community engagement at scale, and will continue to deliver more. Here is a summary of the features with additional details below:\u00a0This month, we\u2019re enabling new ways for organizations to share information across the enterprise with announcements in Google Chat. This gives admin controls to limit permissions for posting in a space, while enabling all members to read and react, helping ensure that important updates stay visible and relevant. Later this year, we plan to simplify membership management by integrating Google Groups with spaces in Chat, enable post-level metrics for announcements, and provide tools for Workspace administrators to manage spaces across their domain.\u00a0Announcements in Google ChatManaging space membership with Google GroupsWe\u2019ve already rolled out new ways to make conversations more expressive and engaging such as in-line threading to enable rich exploration of a specific topic without overtaking the main conversation and custom emojis to enable fun, personal expression.In-line threaded conversationsDiscover and join communities with up to 8,000 membersWe\u2019ve also made it easier for individuals to discover and join communities of shared interest. By searching in Gmail, users can explore a directory of available spaces covering topics of personal or professional interest such as gardening, pets, career development, fitness, cultural identity, and more, with the ability to invite others to join via link. Last year, we increased the size of communities supported by spaces in Chat to 8,000 members, and we are working to scale this in a meaningful way later this year.\u00a0A directory of spaces in Google Chat for users to join.As communities grow, it\u2019s essential to provide tools for content moderation and data management. Last year, we introduced space managers, a community lead with abilities to moderate conversation and manage membership, and last year at NEXT, we rolled out data loss prevention (DLP) for Chat. We will continue to enhance community health and data security for Google Chat.\u00a0Our partner community is extending the power of Chat through integrations with essential third-party apps such as Jira, GitHub, Asana, PagerDuty, Zendesk and Salesforce. Many organizations have built custom workflow apps using low-code and no-code tools, and we anticipate that this number will continue to grow with the GA releases of the Chat API and AppSheet\u2019s Chat app building capabilities later this year.For teams to thrive in this rapidly changing era of hybrid work, it\u2019s essential to build authentic personal connections and a strong sense of belonging, no matter when or where individuals work. We will continue to make Google Chat the best option for Workspace customers seeking to build a community and culture for hybrid teams, with much more to come later this year.\u00a0Who's impactedAdmins and end usersWhy it\u2019s importantThe transition from Currents to spaces in Google Chat removes a separate, siloed destination and provides organizations with a modern, enterprise-grade experience that reflects how the world is working today.

I\u2019m Chris Wallace and I welcome you to what I predict will be a very bad personal experience for me. There will be six 15-minute segments, each on a different topic. At the beginning of each segment, both candidates will get two uninterrupted minutes to respond. The remainder of the segment will be open discussion. The audience has agreed not to be trashy. Both campaigns have signed off on these rules, so for sure nothing will go wrong. And with that, let\u2019s welcome the candidates.\n[CANDIDATES ENTER]\n\n\n\nWallace: Let\u2019s start with the Supreme Court. President Trump, you nominated Amy Coney Barrett to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the court. You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation to nominate someone to the court. Vice President Biden, you\u2019ve called this an abuse of power. To start, why don\u2019t you both explain your positions.\nTrump: Amy Coney Barrett is a perfect nominee. Conservatives love her. Liberals love her. Chris Wallace loves her.\nBiden: Amy Barrett would repeal the Affordable Care Act. And besides, the new thing is that you have to wait until after the election to nominate someone.\nTrump: Not sure what you\u2019re talking about, because last I checked a presidential term is four years, not three. You want to instate Communist medicine.\nBiden: I don\u2019t want to instate Communist medicine. I want to expand Obamacare.\nTrump: Your party wants to instate Communist medicine, and you\u2019re scared of them.\nBiden: I may be scared of them but I am the Democrat Party now, so even if I was and still am scared of them, I\u2019m not anymore. They\u2019ll do what I say now. And how about Covid? The president killed 200,000 people. Roe v. Wade.\nTrump: You would have killed 2 million people by not banning China. Not Roe v. Wade.\nWallace: K let\u2019s go back to healthcare for a minute. Mr. President, over the past four years you have promised to replace and repeal Obamacare, but you have never in these four years come up\u2014\nTrump: Yes I have.\nWallace: with a plan\u2014\nTrump: Of course I have.\nWallace: to\u2014\nTrump: Of course I have.\nWallace: replace\u2014\nTrump: I got rid of the individual mandate.\nWallace: Oba\u2014\nTrump: The individual mandate was a joke.\nWallace: macare.\nTrump: The individual mandate was the worst part of Obamacare.\nWallace: I am the moder\u2014\nTrump: The individual mandate sucks dick.\nWallace: I AM THE MODERATOR of this debate and I would like to be treated as such. You have never come up with a plan to replace Obamacare. So what is the Trump healthcare plan?\nTrump: I\u2019m cutting drug prices. Insulin is like water.\nWallace: Uh huh. How about you Joe? Why do you want to end private insurance?\nBiden: I don\u2019t want to end private insurance.\nTrump: You\u2019re literally friends with Bernie Sanders.\nBiden: No I\u2019m not. I want to\u2014\nTrump: You\u2019re a piece of shit Joe.\nBiden: I want to make sure\u2014\nTrump: A sad little man.\nWallace: Stop picking on Joe, Mr. President.\nTrump: You care deeply about Bernie Sanders. You like Communist medicine. Anyway I asked the doctors and they said Obamacare is a disaster.\nBiden: He doesn\u2019t have a plan.\nWallace: Changing gears, Joe some of your colleagues are talking about ending the filibuster and packing the court. What\u2019s your stance on that?\nBiden: My stance is that voting is good. Americans should vote. It\u2019s easy. You just go to the polling place, you wait in line, and then you go into the booth, and you push the little switch down for the candidate you want to vote for. Sometimes it\u2019s not a switch.\nTrump: You gonna pack the court, Joe? Tell us about how you\u2019re gonna pack the court, Joe. The radical Left is pulling your puppet strings Joe. You and I both know it Joe.\nBiden: Shut up, man.\nWallace: This is going well. Okay next segment. Covid-19. There have been more than 7 million cases in the United States and more than 200,000 have died. The question is, why should people trust you more than your opponent to handle this public health crisis?\nBiden: 40,000 people a day contracting Covid. 200,000 people dead. He has no plan. He knew in February. He lied. He panicked. He complimented China. He has no plan. He\u2019s playing golf.\nTrump: I saved lives. It\u2019s China\u2019s fault. You wanted to let Chinese people come here. Dr. Fauci and all the Democrat governors said, \u201cPresident Trump did a phenomenal job.\u201d And they\u2019re not the only ones. All of the other people said it too. \u201cPresident Trump did a phenomenal job,\u201d they all said. I did a phenomenal job. The gowns, the masks, the ventilators, you don\u2019t know how to make a ventilator, the vaccine is here, any week now. You could never have done the job I did because you\u2019re a random old man. You couldn\u2019t even do swine flu. Swine flu is a disaster.\nBiden:  He panicked. People died. And more people are gonna die unless he gets a lot smarter\u2014\nTrump: Did you just use the word smart? You lied about going to college at Delaware State. You were the worst student at Delaware State. You\u2019re a dumb fuck Joe. I know it. Chris Wallace knows it don\u2019t you Chris.\nWallace:\nTrump:\nBiden:\nWallace: Mr. President, you have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks. Are you not in favor of masks?\nTrump: Masks are tremendous. I have a mask right here in my pocket. I wear masks when needed. Masks have said I\u2019ve done a phenomenal job. Joe wears masks even when it makes no sense. He wears them when he\u2019s 200 feet away from me. He wears a mask when he\u2019s sleeping.\nWallace: Mr. Vice President, is that true?\nBiden: If you wanna open a business, you gotta have a plan.\nWallace: Sir, I was asking about masks.\nBiden: Oh masks? Sure, you gotta have a mask.\nWallace: Alright next segment. The economy. Mr. Trump, you go first.\nTrump: It\u2019s a big dick economy.\nBiden: No.\nWallace: Okay how about taxes. Mr. President, apparently you pay $750 a year in taxes. There\u2019s a girl my daughter knows who\u2019s 15 and she works in a movie theater on Sundays and sells the candy. And she pays more than $750 a year in taxes. So is this true, Mr. President? How much did you pay in taxes in 2016 and 2017?\nTrump: Miyyons.\nWallace: Miyyons, sir?\nTrump: Miyyons and Biyyons. I don\u2019t pay taxes because the Obama administration said I didn\u2019t have to.\nWallace: Joe, what\u2019s your plan for taxes?\nBiden: I\u2019m gonna build this economy. I\u2019m gonna make jobs. We\u2019re gonna buy American. We\u2019re gonna buy American ships. American steel. American buildings. We handed him a booming economy and he blew it.\nWallace: But did you actually hand him a booming economy and did he actually blow it?\nBiden: Sure, whatever. He talks about the art of the deal. China has perfected the art of the steal.\nTrump: China buttered your son\u2019s belly.\nBiden: China did no such thing.\nTrump: And then, Joe? You know what happened after that? Your son went to Moscow. And you know what happened there Joe? Moscow buttered your son\u2019s belly.\nBiden: Nothing happened there.\nTrump: Sure did Joe. The mayor of Moscow\u2019s wife. She buttered his belly slick.\nBiden: You wanna talk about families Trump? How about your family. With their grease and their shoes. It\u2019s not about families. It\u2019s about the American people. It\u2019s about families.\nTrump: Oh and how about Ukraine?\nWallace: You know what? Time to move on to\u2014\nTrump: Ukraine buttered the shit out of\u2014\nWallace: Mr. President.\nTrump: Ukraine buttered him up real good.\nWallace: Mr. President.\nTrump: Shut your mouth Chris. What about Ukraine Joe?\nWallace: VAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH\nTrump:\nWallace: Now I\u2019m gonna say something and I want you to listen right to me, Mr. President. I have had it up to here with you. Any more misbehaving and I will put you in timeout.\nTrump: And you know what else\u2014\nWallace: I will put you right in timeout, Mr. President. And then you\u2019ll be sorry. Now I want you to stop being a bad boy, is that clear?\nTrump: How about him? He should get timeout too.\nWallace: Well frankly, Mr. President, you\u2019ve been the badder boy.\nTrump: He\u2019s been plenty bad.\nWallace: For the next segment, we\u2019ll be talking about race. Why should voters trust you to deal with the race issues facing this country? Mr. Vice President, we\u2019ll start with you.\nBiden: I\u2019m all for race. It\u2019s about equity. About equality. About equanimity. Equilibrium. Equinox. We need to fix the systemic equity of racism and fragility in this country. And this president has done none of that. He wants to fix the systemic equity of the Nazis.\nTrump: The blacks love me. Everyone knows that the blacks love me. I have blacks come up to me on the street all the time and tell me they love me. Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass and I have done more for the blacks than Joe could ever dream of. Joe won\u2019t say law enforcement. Why won\u2019t you say it Joe? Why are you such a puppet Joe? You\u2019re the radical Left\u2019s toy. You\u2019re a yo-yo. The radical Left won\u2019t let you say law enforcement because they bounce you like a yo-yo, Joe.\nWallace: I want to turn to the subject of protests. In many cities, things have turned violent. Portland, for instance, is a certifiable madhouse. Mr. Biden, have you ever called the mayor of Portland or the governor of Oregon and been like, \u201cwtf?\u201d\nBiden: I don\u2019t have their numbers. Otherwise I would have. Do you have their numbers Chris? If you do, text them to me. And besides, they\u2019re taking care of things just fine.\nTrump: Yeah Joe? They\u2019re fine? They\u2019re literally murdering people in the streets, which is a disaster, and no one in Portland cares.\nWallace: Mr. President do you like or not like white supremacists?\nTrump: No of course not. I don\u2019t not like, or don\u2019t not not like any of the people.\nWallace:\nTrump: \nWallace: Mr. President, what is your message to white supremacists?\nTrump: Get your guns but don\u2019t fire till I give the word. Anyway the Left is committing 99% of the violence right now.\nBiden: Oh baloney. Antifa is an idea, not an organization. I heard it means anti-fascist, in which case heck, sign me up. And anyhow who hasn\u2019t thrown urine at an old lady on a bad day? The Antifas are just like you and me.\nWallace: I\u2019m having an awful time here. I\u2019m really upset and I want to leave and I\u2019m having a bad, bad time. For the next segment, let\u2019s just go with \u201cwhy should you be president over your opponent?\u201d\nTrump: There has never been a leader who has done more than I\u2019ve done. And I don\u2019t mean just U.S. presidents. Mandela. Attila the Hun. Caesar. King Tut. None of them did as much as I\u2019ve done. I unified this country. For the first time in U.S. history, I ended division. I have the first 100% approval rating. And how about judges. I have 300 judges. I have judges up the ass, Chris. You know why? Because Obama and crazy Uncle Joe forgot to fill the seats. Who does that. No one does that. You forget your keys, sure I\u2019ve forgotten my keys, I\u2019m human, we all forget our keys, sometimes I leave my keys. But leaving judges is a disaster.\nBiden: This man has made the country weaker, sicker, poorer, fatter, sloppier, and slipperier. When I was Vice President I went head-to-head with Putin, but Trump is Putin\u2019s little puppy. His cuddle-bunny. His bushy-bushy-boo-boo.\nTrump: At least Putin\u2019s not my sugar daddy, like he is to your son.\nBiden: K speaking of that, fuck off. Second, you talk about the military being losers\u2014my son was in Iraq and he was no loser, he was a patriot.\nTrump: Which son, the loser or the dead one?\nBiden: \nWallace:\nTrump: I don\u2019t know the dead one, but if I recall, the loser got thrown out of the military, dishonorably discharged for having a nice time with his cocaine, only to then head off on his famous belly-buttering tour.\nBiden: His belly is dry!\nWallace: Oh for fuck\u2019s sake. Let\u2019s move on to climate change. Mr. President, what do you believe about the science of climate change, and what is your plan to confront it?\nTrump: I want clean water and air. As far as the California fires are concerned, the forest floors are full of dead trees and leaves.\nWallace: Okay but what do you believe about the science of climate change?\nTrump: I want clean water and air. I\u2019ve planted a biyyon trees. We\u2019ve got to pick the leaves up in the forest in California. Every year I get the call. California\u2019s burning again. Because again they didn\u2019t pick up the fucking leaves. You know in Europe, they pick up leaves.\nWallace: Joe?\nBiden: I want to get rid of fossil fuel plants and invest in renewable energy. I want to transition to electric cars and make green buildings and create millions of new jobs.\nTrump: He\u2019s talking about the Green New Deal. The 55 quadrillion dollar Green New Deal.\nBiden: The Green New Deal is a plan that\u2019ll pay for itself. It\u2019ll work great.\nWallace: Do you support the Green New Deal?\nBiden: Of course not. I\u2019m talking about the Biden Plan. Who said anything about the Green New Deal?\nWallace: Mercifully, we\u2019ve reached the final segment of my extremely awful night. Election integrity. How confident should we be that this will be a fair election?\nBiden: There is no evidence that mail-in ballots are problematic. Trump is trying to convince people not to vote. Listen to me America. Get out there and vote. If I get enough votes, this whole thing is over and the bad man can\u2019t hurt you. It doesn\u2019t matter what he says, if I get enough votes he\u2019s legit not in power anymore, how rad is that.\nWallace: Mr. President?\nTrump: A squirrel\u2019s ass, Chris. That\u2019s where someone found a ballot the other day. A squirrel shit out a ballot in a park in Philadelphia and a man picked it up and guess what? It said Trump on the ballot. Big shocker there. This is what happens with mail-in ballots. They end up in a trash can in a river in the woods in the backcountry and then eventually the trash can gets caught up in an eddy, we both know how eddies work Chris, and it washes up on the bank, and then a squirrel gets into it and eats the ballots. Half the country\u2019s ballots have already been found in eddies and in squirrels, and all of them were votes for me. Mail-in ballots are a fraud.\nWallace: One thing we all know for sure is that this election is going to be a shitshow. Will you accept the results of the shitshow and tell your supporters to accept the results peacefully?\nTrump: If there\u2019s no fraud, yes.\nWallace: Is there any foreseeable outcome where you lose and you don\u2019t say it\u2019s fraud?\nTrump: No. I\u2019ve already talked about the squirrels. If I lose, we\u2019ll need to end the country.\nWallace: Biden?\nBiden: The country can go on if I lose.\nWallace: And that concludes what will end up as a stain on my career even though it clearly wasn\u2019t my fault.

For information on the previous deprecation of Google+ for users with personal Google accounts, please see this post.\u00a0What's ChangingLast year, we announced plans to wind down Currents, to focus efforts on community experiences that are better integrated with the rest of Google Workspace. To help our customers manage this transition, we published detailed guidance for Workspace administrators and enabled customers to opt-in for automated migration of Currents data to spaces in Google Chat.\u00a0We are nearing the end of this transition. Beginning July 5, 2023, Currents will no longer be available. Workspace administrators can export Currents data using Takeout before August 8, 2023. Beginning August 8th, Currents data will no longer be available for download.\u00a0Although we are saying goodbye to Currents, we continue to invest in new features for Google Chat, so teams can connect and collaborate with a shared sense of belonging. Over the last year, we've delivered features designed to support community engagement at scale, and will continue to deliver more. Here is a summary of the features with additional details below:\u00a0This month, we\u2019re enabling new ways for organizations to share information across the enterprise with announcements in Google Chat. This gives admin controls to limit permissions for posting in a space, while enabling all members to read and react, helping ensure that important updates stay visible and relevant. Later this year, we plan to simplify membership management by integrating Google Groups with spaces in Chat, enable post-level metrics for announcements, and provide tools for Workspace administrators to manage spaces across their domain.\u00a0Announcements in Google ChatManaging space membership with Google GroupsWe\u2019ve already rolled out new ways to make conversations more expressive and engaging such as in-line threading to enable rich exploration of a specific topic without overtaking the main conversation and custom emojis to enable fun, personal expression.In-line threaded conversationsDiscover and join communities with up to 8,000 membersWe\u2019ve also made it easier for individuals to discover and join communities of shared interest. By searching in Gmail, users can explore a directory of available spaces covering topics of personal or professional interest such as gardening, pets, career development, fitness, cultural identity, and more, with the ability to invite others to join via link. Last year, we increased the size of communities supported by spaces in Chat to 8,000 members, and we are working to scale this in a meaningful way later this year.\u00a0A directory of spaces in Google Chat for users to join.As communities grow, it\u2019s essential to provide tools for content moderation and data management. Last year, we introduced space managers, a community lead with abilities to moderate conversation and manage membership, and last year at NEXT, we rolled out data loss prevention (DLP) for Chat. We will continue to enhance community health and data security for Google Chat.\u00a0Our partner community is extending the power of Chat through integrations with essential third-party apps such as Jira, GitHub, Asana, PagerDuty, Zendesk and Salesforce. Many organizations have built custom workflow apps using low-code and no-code tools, and we anticipate that this number will continue to grow with the GA releases of the Chat API and AppSheet\u2019s Chat app building capabilities later this year.For teams to thrive in this rapidly changing era of hybrid work, it\u2019s essential to build authentic personal connections and a strong sense of belonging, no matter when or where individuals work. We will continue to make Google Chat the best option for Workspace customers seeking to build a community and culture for hybrid teams, with much more to come later this year.\u00a0Who's impactedAdmins and end usersWhy it\u2019s importantThe transition from Currents to spaces in Google Chat removes a separate, siloed destination and provides organizations with a modern, enterprise-grade experience that reflects how the world is working today. Google Workspace customers use Google Chat to communicate about projects, share organizational updates, and build community. \nRecommended action Admins: Review the Change Management Guide. Use Takeout to explore your organization\u2019s Currents data before August 8, 2023.

First, let\u2019s have a little fun. Come with me.\n\n \n  \n\nI haven\u2019t told anyone this before, but I actually live in the fun room. I just gave you a tour of my house, where I spend a large portion of my life thinking about the size of things.\nI have visitors in the fun room from time to time, but after a few minutes, they\u2019re usually pretty funned out and leave me to my crises. But one day, something unexpected happened.\nIt was 2013. Wait But Why was a few months old. And I got an email from someone named Philipp Dettmer. I was slightly unsettled by the pp and tt, but I decided to read what he had to say.\nHe explained that he lives in Germany where he makes animated educational videos about a lot of different things, kind of like Wait But Why but a different medium. I took a look at his YouTube page. It was named a random string of letters:\nkurzgesagt\nApparently it means \u201cIn a Nutshell\u201d in German, but I didn\u2019t know that at the time and was very close to being done with Philipp Dettmer for good when I decided to watch one of the videos.\nIt was delightful.\nI watched another. And another. And then it hit me.\nPhilipp\u2014this random man in Germany\u2014also lives in the fun room.\nThe next day, we were on the phone. There was a lot to talk about. We decided we had to do something together, and we settled on adapting one of my early posts into a kurzgesagt video.1\nIn the seven years since then, Philipp and I have become great friends, and I have not missed a kurzgesagt video since. Whenever Philipp and I get dinner, we head straight to the fun room to talk about the universe. And a few months ago, we decided to collaborate again. It was time to go public with the fun room.\nAt some point in our pasts, we had both become enamored with two fun room icons, Cary and Michael Huang, known on the internet as the Huang Twins. The twins do a lot of cool things, but it was their Scale of the Universe toy that we loved most.\nInspired by their work, we decided to go for it. We wanted to make the best size explorer we could imagine. We called it Universe in a Nutshell.\nOf course, it took roughly 18 times longer than we thought it would. We brainstormed the interface for quite some time, and then Philipp, along with the incredible kurzgesagt team, dug into working on illustrations and animations, while I worked with the team on the written explainers.\nThousands of human hours later, the app is done. 250 objects, 30,000+ words of explanations and fun facts, just the right mood music, and what we think is a pretty great interface.\nHere\u2019s how it works:\nThe app is a giant wall. The wall is impossibly large\u2014large enough to fit full-sized galaxies on it. The wall is also impossibly high-resolution\u2014hi-res enough to contain sharp images of subatomic particles.\nI know it seems weird that I\u2019m talking about it as if it\u2019s a real object, but I have a good reason: to get the full mind-blow effect, you have to realize what you\u2019re looking at. You\u2019re not moving forward and backward through a tunnel of objects\u2014it just seems that way because your brain will refuse to accept the insanity of the actual sizes you\u2019re seeing. By reminding yourself again and again that all of these objects are \u201cpainted\u201d on the same 2D wall, you\u2019ll hopefully experience some fun mind-bending moments.\nThe app looks like this:\n\nAnd this:\n\nAnd this:\n\nAnd there are three ways to zoom:\n\nYou can tap any object for an explainer and fun facts. All of the facts you just read in the fun room are also in the app, along with a million other things. (The surprisingly-good-for-Wait-But-Why-illustrations from the fun room are the work of Kurzgesagt. Don\u2019t think this is some new normal.)\nThree more things:\n1) The app is $3 in the US store, which, considering the fact that a magical infinite wall should really go for like $2.5 million, is a huge steal.\n2) If you like the app, please give it a rating or review. For example, here\u2019s my review:\n\n3) This is V1 of the app. As we made the app, we had a constant side conversation going on about possibilities for V2, V3, and beyond. We\u2019re launching today, but this is just the beginning. We want this app to be a brain playground that just keeps getting better and better. And here\u2019s where you come in.\nAs you use the app, whenever you have an \u201cI wish the app did X\u201d or \u201cIt would be so cool if the app could do Y\u201d thought, we want to hear it. As this is V1, we of course also want to know whenever you have a \u201cThis isn\u2019t working right\u201d or an \u201cI think this fact is off\u201d thought. In the app\u2019s menu, you\u2019ll see a \u201cfeedback\u201d tab, where you can tap the feedback email address and let us know what you\u2019re thinking.\nOkay, here you go. Click the left app for iPhone/iPad, the right one for Android.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n___________\nAlso: To commemorate the app launch, Kurzgesagt did their own fun room creation today\u2014a delightful video

For information on the previous deprecation of Google+ for users with personal Google accounts, please see this post.\u00a0What's ChangingLast year, we announced plans to wind down Currents, to focus efforts on community experiences that are better integrated with the rest of Google Workspace. To help our customers manage this transition, we published detailed guidance for Workspace administrators and enabled customers to opt-in for automated migration of Currents data to spaces in Google Chat.\u00a0We are nearing the end of this transition. Beginning July 5, 2023, Currents will no longer be available. Workspace administrators can export Currents data using Takeout before August 8, 2023. Beginning August 8th, Currents data will no longer be available for download.\u00a0Although we are saying goodbye to Currents, we continue to invest in new features for Google Chat, so teams can connect and collaborate with a shared sense of belonging. Over the last year, we've delivered features designed to support community engagement at scale, and will continue to deliver more. Here is a summary of the features with additional details below:\u00a0This month, we\u2019re enabling new ways for organizations to share information across the enterprise with announcements in Google Chat. This gives admin controls to limit permissions for posting in a space, while enabling all members to read and react, helping ensure that important updates stay visible and relevant. Later this year, we plan to simplify membership management by integrating Google Groups with spaces in Chat, enable post-level metrics for announcements, and provide tools for Workspace administrators to manage spaces across their domain.\u00a0Announcements in Google ChatManaging space membership with Google GroupsWe\u2019ve already rolled out new ways to make conversations more expressive and engaging such as in-line threading to enable rich exploration of a specific topic without overtaking the main conversation and custom emojis to enable fun, personal expression.In-line threaded conversationsDiscover and join communities with up to 8,000 membersWe\u2019ve also made it easier for individuals to discover and join communities of shared interest. By searching in Gmail, users can explore a directory of available spaces covering topics of personal or professional interest such as gardening, pets, career development, fitness, cultural identity, and more, with the ability to invite others to join via link. Last year, we increased the size of communities supported by spaces in Chat to 8,000 members, and we are working to scale this in a meaningful way later this year.\u00a0A directory of spaces in Google Chat for users to join.As communities grow, it\u2019s essential to provide tools for content moderation and data management. Last year, we introduced space managers, a community lead with abilities to moderate conversation and manage membership, and last year at NEXT, we rolled out data loss prevention (DLP) for Chat. We will continue to enhance community health and data security for Google Chat.\u00a0Our partner community is extending the power of Chat through integrations with essential third-party apps such as Jira, GitHub, Asana, PagerDuty, Zendesk and Salesforce. Many organizations have built custom workflow apps using low-code and no-code tools, and we anticipate that this number will continue to grow with the GA releases of the Chat API and AppSheet\u2019s Chat app building capabilities later this year.For teams to thrive in this rapidly changing era of hybrid work, it\u2019s essential to build authentic personal connections and a strong sense of belonging, no matter when or where individuals work. We will continue to make Google Chat the best option for Workspace customers seeking to build a community and culture for hybrid teams, with much more to come later this year.\u00a0Who's impactedAdmins and end usersWhy it\u2019s importantThe transition from Currents to spaces in Google Chat removes a separate, siloed destination and provides organizations with a modern, enterprise-grade experience that reflects how the world is working today. Google Workspace customers use Google Chat to communicate about projects, share organizational updates, and build community. \nRecommended action Admins: Review the Change Management Guide. Use Takeout to explore your organization\u2019s Currents data before August 8, 2023.

Normally, I spend the time diddling around my phone, but I forgot to bring my phone this morning, so I just looked around.\nAs I was taking in the emptiness of the street, a little glint caught my eye in a patch of dirt on the sidewalk. I bent over to look closer, and there was the glint again. It wasn\u2019t a normal glint like from a shiny rock or a piece of metal\u2014it was a little pinprick of flashing light.\nIntrigued, I was now on all fours looking closer. And I saw the most surreal thing.\nTiny houses.\nLike tiny houses. Each about a millimeter high, like ornately carved grains of sand.\nI was either dreaming or looking at the coolest, cutest little art project ever.\nAs I examined the microscopic village, I noticed what looked like a scrawl of teeny letters on the dirt next to the houses. It said:\nPUT YOUR THUMB ON THE OVAL\nNow fully having the time of my life, I looked around for an oval. I searched for a few minutes with no luck until I saw, a bit outside the area where the houses were, a little strip of silver, maybe two millimeters long and a millimeter wide. Careful not to damage the houses, I put my thumb on it.\nI won\u2019t be able to accurately describe what happened next, but I\u2019ll try my best. Imagine if the ground underneath you suddenly felt like a furiously spinning liquid whirlpool, combined with the feeling of freefalling, combined with your entire visual field turning into a blurry gray, combined with the worst nausea of your life.\nAnd then, just as fast as it started, it all stopped. I cowered for a few seconds trying to catch my breath, and when I opened my eyes, I wasn\u2019t in New York anymore.\nI was on a pastoral ranch, surrounded by big log cabins and a bunch of people staring down at me as I looked up at them, still on all fours. One of the people said to me, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\u201cI feel okay, but I\u2019m having severe hallucinations.\u201d\nThey all started cheering and hugging and high-fiving each other.\n\u201cAre you doctors?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cHe thinks he has the virus,\u201d one of them said, and they all roared with laughter.\nA woman shushed the crowd and said, \u201cOkay, back to work everyone. I\u2019ll give him the briefing.\u201d\nThe others left, and the woman smiled at me. \u201cI\u2019m Layla.\u201d\n\u201cHi Layla. Do I have coronavirus?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have coronavirus,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re just tiny. We shrunk you to 1/10,000th of your normal size. You haven\u2019t moved anywhere, you\u2019ve just gotten much smaller.\u201d\n\u201cFuck,\u201d I explained.\n\u201cYeah, I imagine it\u2019s a lot to take in,\u201d she said. \u201cLet me try to clear things up. There are different tiers of human life, not just the one you\u2019re used to. Our tier is exactly 1/10,000th the size of yours. In yours, people are about 180 centimeters tall. Here, we\u2019re about 0.18 millimeters tall. We\u2019d say 180 micrometers tall, but I know in your world, micrometers don\u2019t mean very much.\u201d\nI stared at her. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me I\u2019m 0.18 millimeters tall right now?\u201d\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d she said. \u201cAbout half the size of a dust mite, or a little taller than the width of a human hair up in your world. A person in your world with really good eyesight could barely see you, if they looked closely. And see that house over there?\u201d She pointed to a large, three-story house. \u201cIn the scale you\u2019re used to, that would be about 10 meters high. Here, it\u2019s about the size of a cubic millimeter\u2014the size of a grain of sand on the sidewalk. Some of our houses were actually carved from grains of sand.\u201d\n\u201cHold on.\u201d I stopped her. \u201cI\u2019m very scared of bugs. I wrote a whole post about it once. Are there giant bugs here?\u201d\n\u201cYes and no. There are no bugs in our village because we lined the perimeter with a poison that kills any insects that come too close. But you wouldn\u2019t want to walk too far away from the houses\u2014about three centimeters from here, you\u2019ll cross that barrier and run into things you won\u2019t like.\u201d\n\u201cHow about flying bugs?\u201d I asked diligently.\n\u201cOh, I haven\u2019t mentioned time yet. Okay so time here moves 100 times faster than it does up on your tier. Time scales up inversely with the square root of the size difference. So 1/10,000th of the size means 100X faster time. So when a flying insect starts to descend into the village, our defense crew has over a minute here to handle the situation. They fire a jet of air at the insect that deflects it away from us. Same deal for dogs. Every year or two, a dog will pee on us. The defense crew keeps track of every dog walking by. At 1/100th the speed of our world, we first see an approaching dog about ten minutes before it gets near us, and by the time a peeing dog is lifting its leg over us, we\u2019ve had plenty of time to draw the tarps, which roll over the entire village and cover everything\u2014the same tarps we use every time it rains or snows.\u201d\n\u201cGood to know. But why am I here?\u201d\n\u201cRight, I was about to get to that. After a heated debate in the village, we voted to bring someone from your world here, because we wanted to show you something. We\u2019ve been trying to catch someone\u2019s eye in your world for three of your weeks. That\u2019s almost six years here. That\u2019s why everyone was so excited to see you.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you catch my attention?\u201d\n\u201cWith that.\u201d She pointed at a tube on the roof of one of the houses that looked like large telescope. \u201cThat\u2019s a super-powered laser that we\u2019ve been trying to shine in people\u2019s eyes as they walked by on the sidewalk. But no one noticed. Until today. Way out on the horizon, we piled boulders into the shapes of letters that spelled out the instructions, and you were dicking around just hard enough that you actually bent down to read them. We\u2019re thankful.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was that oval in the instructions?\u201d\n\u201cLook down.\u201d\nI was standing on a metallic oval about the size of a swimming pool.\n\u201cThis is our trans-tier station. When you touched this with your thumb, it shrunk you down to our tier.\n\u201cWait.\u201d I looked up at her. \u201cDo I live here now?\u201d\nShe laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll send you back to your world in a little bit. Now come with me.\u201d\nI walked with Layla towards the other side of the village. I looked around. Everyone was staring at me. Some people waved.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I asked Layla, pointing up at what looked like a sheet of color stretching into the sky.\n\u201cThat\u2019s your apartment building. All you can see from here is the first brick. That band of light way up in the sky is the mortar between the first and second brick in the wall.\u201d\nWe walked into a small building and entered a room with a long white table in the middle. Layla turned towards a wall on the side of the room, and suddenly the outline of a square formed in the wall. The square moved outwards into the room and rotated downwards until it was parallel to the floor. Layla pulled a tweezer-like tool from her pocket and carefully pinched what looked like nothing a few centimeters above the panel.\nShe walked over to me. \u201cOpen your palm.\u201d\nShe put her tweezers into my hand and dropped something the size of a grain of sand. I raised up my palm to look at it. It was reddish and fuzzy.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cSARS-CoV-2. What you\u2019ve been calling \u2018coronavirus.\u2019\u201d\nI flung it across the room. \u201cWhat the fuck.\u201d\nLayla laughed, touched the square, and the little object flew back across the room into its spot above the square.\n\u201cIt can\u2019t hurt you here. The viruses of your world are way too big to do any damage in our bodies.\u201d\nI stared at her, trying to process the situation. \u201cHow do you know about coronavirus? And how did you\u2026get one?\u201d\n\u201cOh we know everything about your world. Your tier moves so slowly compared to ours that your technology is eons behind ours. Our tools have allowed us to watch your world since your prehistoric days. As for how we got a coronavirus particle, we didn\u2019t get it\u2014we made it.\u201d\n\u201cYou made the coronavirus?\u201d\n\u201cWell, with a little help. Follow me.\u201d\nAgain I followed Layla, again dumbfounded, this time out of the building toward a fenced-in area outside. When we got close, a door in the fence opened and inside, we stood together on the edge of what looked like a barren circle of land.\nLayla opened her hand. The little virus was sitting neatly on her palm. \u201cSARS-CoV-2 is a standard sized Coronavirus\u2014about 120 nanometers in diameter. 120 nanometers is ridiculously small in your world, but in ours, you can roll it around in your fingers.\n\u201cCool\u2026let me think about that for a minute.\u201d\n\u201cWait, I can explain this better. In your world, this is a perfect size analogy:\nSARS-CoV-2 : grain of sand :: grain of sand : house\nIn both cases, the relationship is 1-to-10,000, which is also the relationship of our world to yours. In your world, your apartment building is huge, a grain of sand is tiny, and this coronavirus is unfathomably microscopic. In ours, the virus is tiny, a grain of your sand is huge enough to live in, and your apartment building is unfathomably large.\u201d\n\u201cMakes sense.\u201d\n\u201cNow, what\u2019s a virus made of? Atoms. And atoms are about 0.1 nanometers in diameter\u2014about 1/1,000th of the diameter of a SARS-CoV-2 particle. That\u2019s small even for us. An atom is almost as small for us as a virus is for you. Constructing a virus requires incredibly complex engineering and tools that can interact with the quantum field. We can\u2019t do it ourselves.\u201d\n\u201cSo how\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLook down.\u201d\nI looked at the ground.\nShe pulled me toward the center of the circle of land and then pulled me to an abrupt stop.\n\u201cLook closer.\u201d\nI bent over as far as I could and strained my eyes. No. Fucking. Way.\nAnother microscopic world.\n\u201cIs that\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYup. That\u2019s the tier below us. Give me your thumb.\u201d\nShe carefully placed the virus particle onto the ground. Then she guided my hand to the ground, touching both of our thumbs to a little metallic spot.\nWhirlpool. Falling. Gray. Nausea. Misery.\nI eventually got a hold of my trembling and drooling and opened my eyes. In every direction, as far as I could see, stretched a hazy blue-ish / purple-ish plane. It also began to dawn on me that I wasn\u2019t standing or sitting on anything\u2014I was floating.\nAfter about a minute of wondering what the hell was going on in my life, a patch of the sky darkened. The dark region became smaller and more defined until it condensed into Layla floating next to me.\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me again,\u201d I said.\n\u201cSorry, my thumb hit the pad a split second later than yours did. Time moves 100 times faster here than up there, so you got to spend some reflective time here by yourself.\u201d\n\u201cOkay where are we?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re outside your apartment building. Remember?\u201d\n\u201cRighttt. So what size are we?\u201d\n\u201cWe went down the same jump you did when you transitioned from your world to ours\u2014we shrunk to 1/10,000th of our previous size. So you\u2019re now 18 nanometers tall. If you stood on the edge of a cross-section of a human hair, it would take you about two hours to walk across it.\u201d\n\u201cJesus.\u201d\n\u201cTime here is now going by at 100X the speed of time in my world, which means it\u2019s moving 10,000 times faster than the speed of time in yours. You could spend a year here and less than an hour would pass in your world.\u201d\n\u201cKind of like Inception?\u201d\n\u201cNot really. Anyway, nothing down here works the way it does in our worlds. Like see how the ground is all eternal and purply?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not really ground, and it\u2019s not really purple. When you\u2019re this small, there aren\u2019t any solid objects in the sense you understand. And your eyes are too small now to perceive the visible light spectrum.\u201d\n\u201cSo what the hell?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t really get it either. But the people who live here have incredibly advanced ways of manipulating the quantum field so we can feel like we\u2019re intact humans, floating in place, seeing purple. They set it up this way because it\u2019s something we can make sense of.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice of them. Where are they all anyway?\u201d\n\u201cThe thing is, they don\u2019t like our world, and they really don\u2019t like your world. They interact with us occasionally, when it\u2019s necessary, but they\u2019ll never allow you or anyone from your world to see them or know anything about how they live. This is actually the first time anyone from your world has been allowed down here, other than Andy Kaufman, who\u2019s lived here since 1984.\u201d\n\u201cThen why am I allowed to be here?\u201d\n\u201cSo I can show you this.\u201d\nLayla straightened her arm in front of her, with her palm facing outwards. Her palm lit up and when it did, a bizarre-looking giant object was revealed in front of us.\n\u201cThis,\u201d Layla said, \u201cis SARS-CoV-2. Down here, it\u2019s the size of a house.\u201d\nI looked up at the vast virus in front of me. It looked nothing like it had when it was a fuzzy grain of sand in my hand. It was transparent, like a massive, intricately structured, sphere-shaped jellyfish. There was a kind of furious movement within the transparency, but I couldn\u2019t see anything specific moving. It was confusing.\nLayla motioned for me to come close to the virus. She took my hand and placed my palm onto the virus\u2019s almost invisible surface. It felt kind of like palming a grape bunch except instead of grapes it was tapioca balls like the ones in those bubble teas\u2014if the tapioca balls were vibrating so vigorously that it felt a little like being mildly electroshocked, like when you put your finger in an electrical outlet. It was an unpleasant sensation, though not quite painful, and super weird and cool-feeling.\n\u201cPull one off,\u201d Layla said.\nIt took me a few tries to latch onto one of the atoms, because they\u2019re \u201cslippery\u201d (quotes because there is no word for what it felt like, but \u201cslippery\u201d gets the general idea across), and when I finally got one and pulled, there was a lot of resistance. When I pulled it, it dragged the adjacent atoms along with it, and the harder I pulled, the more ferociously and unpleasantly it vibrated. Finally it snapped free. I looked at my fist\u2014I had an atom.\nLayla smiled. \u201cCool right?\u201d\n\u201cSo cool. Can I keep it?\u201d\n\u201cSure good luck with that.\u201d\nI was so awe-struck by so many things, I had forgotten how intensely confused I was.\n\u201cWait, so why did you make this?\u201d\nShe turned towards me. \u201cAs I said, because of the way time moves\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYour world has been around a lot longer than ours.\u201d\n\u201cYes. And this world we\u2019re in now has been around a lot longer than mine. They know much more about everything than we do, and they can do things we can\u2019t even begin to understand. The stuff they can do is so over our heads they can\u2019t even explain it to us. And we\u2019re that far ahead of your world.\nFor a long time, as advanced as this world was, it relied on us to preserve our world for its own survival. It exists on a patch of dirt in our village. If our village were destroyed, they would be destroyed with it. But a while back, they worked out the technology for how to be location independent, which means they can move from wherever they are to any other place in the universe instantly.\nWe don\u2019t have that technology yet. We tried to learn from them, but we couldn\u2019t grasp the fundamental ideas well enough to develop it ourselves. So we\u2019re stuck in our location.\u201d\n\u201cIn New York City?\u201d\n\u201cYup. We migrated here in the 1800s when we determined it would be a good place to interface with your world, should the need ever arise. We\u2019re also not the only people in our world. There are lots of villages like ours in different parts of the Earth. Once we connected with you, the others stopped broadcasting their location. There\u2019s no reason for more than one of us to be revealed to your world.\nFor most of time, Earth was a safe and stable home for our world. But over the last century, your world has been advancing exponentially in technology but remaining stagnant in wisdom. You\u2019re rapidly gaining tremendous powers but still behaving like short-sighted primates. The voice of wisdom is there, but it\u2019s being trampled over by political parties, religions, and nations too mired in blind conflict to lift their heads up and see the bigger picture.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny you say that Layla. I\u2019m actually writing a whole thing about\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh I know. We did our research on everyone who lives in your vicinity so we\u2019d know how to communicate with the person we brought to us if we caught someone\u2019s attention. That\u2019s why I\u2019m speaking English and speaking in the odd way you do. Your little series is cute, even if it took us forever to read\u2014but it will have limited effect. Your world is stubborn about growing up. And in the process of destroying yourselves, we believe you\u2019ll destroy us as well.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re trying to kill us off with a pandemic.\u201d\n\u201cIf we wanted to kill you off, you\u2019d all be dead right now. It\u2019s an option we hope we don\u2019t have to use. We were once like you and we empathize with your struggle.\nWe created this coronavirus to fall into a certain sweet spot\u2014not damaging enough to destroy your world, but bad enough to cause a long and scary global crisis. Short of an alien attack, it is the one thing that could make all humans in your world feel like they\u2019re on the same team against a common enemy. The first and most crucial step on the road to a long-lasting species is the epiphany that you truly are a single team, alone in a dark and dangerous universe. We\u2019re hoping the virus can help push you in that direction.\u201d\n\u201cI feel like there was a better way to do this.\u201d\n\u201cWe probably could have thought a little harder about it.\u201d\n\u201cYeah cause it\u2019s going pretty badly up there is the thing.\u201d\n\u201cTotes. Anyway, we couldn\u2019t make the virus on our own. It\u2019s hard enough to make something that small and complex that involves atomic and subatomic construction, but we wanted the virus to be precisely as harmful as it is. We needed help. The tier below us is less vulnerable to your world than we are, but for reasons I\u2019m not entirely sure about, they also believe living in a multi-tiered ecosystem may be important in the future\u2014so they share our interests. They agreed to build the virus for us.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you manage to get the virus into our world?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny. You have to imagine it from our perspective. If you\u2019re us, the world you\u2019re planning to transform is a planet with nearly an AU diameter, full of 18-kilometer tall people\u2014people so tall, your world\u2019s airplanes could accidentally fly into their belly buttons. Now imagine you\u2019re standing on that planet, smaller than one of their dust mites, pinching between your fingers something the size of a grain of sand on your scale. You find your way onto one of these giants\u2019 football-field-size teeth, and you flick the grain of sand into his kilometer-wide chasm of a mouth. And that\u2019s supposed to change the trajectory of their future. It seems impossible.\n\u201cAnd yet.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet. With some very clever maneuvers, we flicked our little particle into the mouth of an unlucky giant, and it did the trick. By the way, we were dying when you blamed it on a pangolin of all things.\u201d\n\u201cHe seemed guilty. I still don\u2019t understand why you brought me down here.\u201d\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t originally planning to reveal any of this backstory to your world. But after watching things unfold for the first few weeks, we don\u2019t see enough of the effect we were hoping for. Maybe if your world learns that there are other worlds out there\u2014worlds that did manage to triumph in the wisdom game\u2014it\u2019ll empower the wise voices to stand up with a bit more courage in this struggle and in even greater challenges that lie ahead. It\u2019s a long shot, but these are desperate times.\u201d\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s worth a try. I\u2019ll write a post explaining what I learned from you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd tweet out the post and send it out to your email list and stuff?\u201d\n\u201cEh. Fine.\u201d\n\u201cReady to go back up to your life? Only 23 seconds have passed there since you shrunk down.\u201d\n\u201cYeah let\u2019s do it.\u201d\nLayla and I moved ourselves on top of the big metal oval.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to increase my size 10,000-fold and yours 100,000,000-fold, so you can go back home in one shot\u2026which is a good thing because transporting up is even worse than transporting down.\u201d\n\u201cGreat\u2026\u201d\n\u201cReady?\u201d\n\u201cI have one more question.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cHow many tiers are there?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cNo one knows for sure. The people on this atomic-level tier tell us they know of at least one tier below them, though they won\u2019t tell us more than that. And no one seems to know about tiers above yours. Your world is thinking about that, with all your multiverse talk. We\u2019re still working on that one too.\u201d\n\u201cIf you ever figure it out, will you let me know?\u201d\n\u201cOne thing at a time.\u201d\nWe touched our thumbs to the metal.\n___________\nIf

For information on the previous deprecation of Google+ for users with personal Google accounts, please see this post.\u00a0What's ChangingLast year, we announced plans to wind down Currents, to focus efforts on community experiences that are better integrated with the rest of Google Workspace. To help our customers manage this transition, we published detailed guidance for Workspace administrators and enabled customers to opt-in for automated migration of Currents data to spaces in Google Chat.\u00a0We are nearing the end of this transition. Beginning July 5, 2023, Currents will no longer be available. Workspace administrators can export Currents data using Takeout before August 8, 2023. Beginning August 8th, Currents data will no longer be available for download.\u00a0Although we are saying goodbye to Currents, we continue to invest in new features for Google Chat, so teams can connect and collaborate with a shared sense of belonging. Over the last year, we've delivered features designed to support community engagement at scale, and will continue to deliver more. Here is a summary of the features with additional details below:\u00a0This month, we\u2019re enabling new ways for organizations to share information across the enterprise with announcements in Google Chat. This gives admin controls to limit permissions for posting in a space, while enabling all members to read and react, helping ensure that important updates stay visible and relevant. Later this year, we plan to simplify membership management by integrating Google Groups with spaces in Chat, enable post-level metrics for announcements, and provide tools for Workspace administrators to manage spaces across their domain.\u00a0Announcements in Google ChatManaging space membership with Google GroupsWe\u2019ve already rolled out new ways to make conversations more expressive and engaging such as in-line threading to enable rich exploration of a specific topic without overtaking the main conversation and custom emojis to enable fun, personal expression.In-line threaded conversationsDiscover and join communities with up to 8,000 membersWe\u2019ve also made it easier for individuals to discover and join communities of shared interest. By searching in Gmail, users can explore a directory of available spaces covering topics of personal or professional interest such as gardening, pets, career development, fitness, cultural identity, and more, with the ability to invite others to join via link. Last year, we increased the size of communities supported by spaces in Chat to 8,000 members, and we are working to scale this in a meaningful way later this year.\u00a0A directory of spaces in Google Chat for users to join.As communities grow, it\u2019s essential to provide tools for content moderation and data management. Last year, we introduced space managers, a community lead with abilities to moderate conversation and manage membership, and last year at NEXT, we rolled out data loss prevention (DLP) for Chat. We will continue to enhance community health and data security for Google Chat.\u00a0Our partner community is extending the power of Chat through integrations with essential third-party apps such as Jira, GitHub, Asana, PagerDuty, Zendesk and Salesforce. Many organizations have built custom workflow apps using low-code and no-code tools, and we anticipate that this number will continue to grow with the GA releases of the Chat API and AppSheet\u2019s Chat app building capabilities later this year.For teams to thrive in this rapidly changing era of hybrid work, it\u2019s essential to build authentic personal connections and a strong sense of belonging, no matter when or where individuals work. We will continue to make Google Chat the best option for Workspace customers seeking to build a community and culture for hybrid teams, with much more to come later this year.\u00a0Who's impactedAdmins and end usersWhy it\u2019s importantThe transition from Currents to spaces in Google Chat removes a separate, siloed destination and provides organizations with a modern, enterprise-grade experience that reflects how the world is working today. Google Workspace customers use Google Chat to communicate about projects, share organizational updates, and build community. \nRecommended action Admins: Review the Change Management Guide. Use Takeout to explore your organization\u2019s Currents data before August 8, 2023.

It\u2019s exciting. \u201cThe twenties\u201d is super legit-sounding, and it\u2019s so old school. The 40s are old. The 30s even more so. But nothing is older school than the Roaring 20s.\nWe\u2019re now in charge of making this a cool decade so when people 100 years from now are thinking about how incredibly old-timey the 2020s were, it\u2019s old-timey in a cool appealing way and not a boring shitty way.\nIt\u2019s also weird that to us, the 2020s sounds like such a rad futuristic decade\u2014and that\u2019s how the 1920s seemed to people 100 years ago today. They were all used to the 19-teens, and suddenly they were like, \u201cwhoa cool we\u2019re in the twenties!\u201d Then they got upset thinking about how much farther along in life their 1910 self thought they\u2019d be by 1920.\nIn any case, it\u2019s a perfect time for one of those \u201cshit we\u2019re old\u201d posts.\nSo here are some New Years 2020 time facts:\nWhen World War 2 started, the Civil War felt as far away to Americans as WW2 feels to us now.\n\nSpeaking of World War 2, the world wars were pretty close together. If World War 2 were starting today, World War 1 would feel about as far back to us as 9/11.\n\nThe Soviet Union break up is now as distant a memory as JFK\u2019s assassination was when the Soviet Union broke up.\n\nMoving on to more inane topics, there have been more Super Bowls since the 1993 Cowboys\u2013Bills SB than before it.\n\nAnd West Germany\u2019s 1974 World Cup victory happened closer to the first World Cup in 1930 than to today.\nThe Wonder Years aired from 1988 and 1993 and depicted the years between 1968 and 1973. When I watched the show, it felt like it was set in a time long ago. If a new Wonder Years premiered today, it would cover the years between 2000 and 2005.\n\nAlso, remember when Jurassic Park, The Lion King, and Forrest Gump came out in theaters? Closer to the moon landing than today.\n\nY2K? Closer to the 70s than today.\n\nMeanwhile, the O.J. Simpson trial is now half way between the 1960s and today. And closer to the Charles Manson trial.\n\nAs for you, if you\u2019re 60 or older, you were born closer to the 1800s than today.\n\nToday\u2019s 35-year-olds were born closer to the 1940s than to today. \n\nThere are a lot of options for that kind of calculation, but those two seemed like the most depressing to me. Worth mentioning that my 94-year-old grandmother was born closer to the Andrew Jackson administration than to today.\nIf you were born in the 1980s like me, a kid today who\u2019s the age you were in 1990 is a full 30-year generation younger than you. They\u2019ll remember Obama\u2019s presidency the way you remember Reagan\u2019s. 9/11 to them is the moon landing for you. The 90s seem as ancient to them as the 60s seem to you. To you, the 70s are just a little before your time\u2014that\u2019s how they think of the 2000s. They see the 70s how you see the 40s. And the hippy 60s seems as old to them as the Great Depression seems to you. \nBut the weirdest thing about kids today: most of them will live to see the 2100s.\nSorry if this stressed you out. Happy New Year!\n___________\nIf you like Wait But Why, sign up for the email list and we\u2019ll send you new posts when they come out.

For information on the previous deprecation of Google+ for users with personal Google accounts, please see this post.\u00a0What's ChangingLast year, we announced plans to wind down Currents, to focus efforts on community experiences that are better integrated with the rest of Google Workspace. To help our customers manage this transition, we published detailed guidance for Workspace administrators and enabled customers to opt-in for automated migration of Currents data to spaces in Google Chat.\u00a0We are nearing the end of this transition. Beginning July 5, 2023, Currents will no longer be available. Workspace administrators can export Currents data using Takeout before August 8, 2023. Beginning August 8th, Currents data will no longer be available for download.\u00a0Although we are saying goodbye to Currents, we continue to invest in new features for Google Chat, so teams can connect and collaborate with a shared sense of belonging. Over the last year, we've delivered features designed to support community engagement at scale, and will continue to deliver more. Here is a summary of the features with additional details below:\u00a0This month, we\u2019re enabling new ways for organizations to share information across the enterprise with announcements in Google Chat. This gives admin controls to limit permissions for posting in a space, while enabling all members to read and react, helping ensure that important updates stay visible and relevant. Later this year, we plan to simplify membership management by integrating Google Groups with spaces in Chat, enable post-level metrics for announcements, and provide tools for Workspace administrators to manage spaces across their domain.\u00a0Announcements in Google ChatManaging space membership with Google GroupsWe\u2019ve already rolled out new ways to make conversations more expressive and engaging such as in-line threading to enable rich exploration of a specific topic without overtaking the main conversation and custom emojis to enable fun, personal expression.In-line threaded conversationsDiscover and join communities with up to 8,000 membersWe\u2019ve also made it easier for individuals to discover and join communities of shared interest. By searching in Gmail, users can explore a directory of available spaces covering topics of personal or professional interest such as gardening, pets, career development, fitness, cultural identity, and more, with the ability to invite others to join via link. Last year, we increased the size of communities supported by spaces in Chat to 8,000 members, and we are working to scale this in a meaningful way later this year.\u00a0A directory of spaces in Google Chat for users to join.As communities grow, it\u2019s essential to provide tools for content moderation and data management. Last year, we introduced space managers, a community lead with abilities to moderate conversation and manage membership, and last year at NEXT, we rolled out data loss prevention (DLP) for Chat. We will continue to enhance community health and data security for Google Chat.\u00a0Our partner community is extending the power of Chat through integrations with essential third-party apps such as Jira, GitHub, Asana, PagerDuty, Zendesk and Salesforce. Many organizations have built custom workflow apps using low-code and no-code tools, and we anticipate that this number will continue to grow with the GA releases of the Chat API and AppSheet\u2019s Chat app building capabilities later this year.For teams to thrive in this rapidly changing era of hybrid work, it\u2019s essential to build authentic personal connections and a strong sense of belonging, no matter when or where individuals work. We will continue to make Google Chat the best option for Workspace customers seeking to build a community and culture for hybrid teams, with much more to come later this year.\u00a0Who's impactedAdmins and end usersWhy it\u2019s importantThe transition from Currents to spaces in Google Chat removes a separate, siloed destination and provides organizations with a modern, enterprise-grade experience that reflects how the world is working today.

Quick note before we jump in:\nThis is a post about something I\u2019ve been wanting to write about forever: careers. Society tells us a lot of things about what we should want in a career and what the possibilities are\u2014which is weird because I\u2019m pretty sure society knows very little about any of this. When it comes to careers, society is like your great uncle who traps you at holidays and goes on a 15-minute mostly incoherent unsolicited advice monologue, and you tune out almost the whole time because it\u2019s super clear he has very little idea what he\u2019s talking about and that everything he says is like 45 years outdated. Society is like that great uncle, and conventional wisdom is like his rant. Except in this case, instead of tuning it out, we pay rapt attention to every word, and then we make major career decisions based on what he says. Kind of a weird thing for us to do.\nThis post isn\u2019t me giving you career advice really\u2014it\u2019s a framework that I think can help you make career decisions that actually reflect who you are, what you want, and what our rapidly changing career landscape looks like today. You\u2019re not a pro at this, but you\u2019re certainly more qualified to figure out what\u2019s best for you than our collective un-self-aware great uncle. For those of you yet to start your career who aren\u2019t sure what you want to do with their lives, or those of you currently in the middle of your career who aren\u2019t sure you\u2019re on the right path, I hope this post can help you press the reset button on your thought process and get some clarity.\n\u2013 Tim\nPDF: If you want to print this post or read it offline, the PDF is probably the way to go. You can buy it here.\n_______\nYour Life Path So Far\nFor most of us, childhood is kind of like a river, and we\u2019re kind of like tadpoles.\n\nWe didn\u2019t choose the river. We just woke up out of nowhere and found ourselves on some path set for us by our parents, by society, and by circumstances. We\u2019re told the rules of the river and the way we should swim and what our goals should be. Our job isn\u2019t to think about our path\u2014it\u2019s to succeed on the path we\u2019ve been placed on, based on the way success has been defined for us.\nFor many of us\u2014and I suspect for a large portion of Wait But Why readers\u2014our childhood river then feeds into a pond, called college.1 We may have some say in which particular pond we landed in, but in the end, most college ponds aren\u2019t really that different from one another.\n\nIn the pond, we have a bit more breathing room and some leeway to branch out into more specific interests. We start to ponder, looking out at the pond\u2019s shores\u2014out there where the real world starts and where we\u2019ll be spending the rest of our lives. This usually brings some mixed feelings.\n\nAnd then, 22 years after waking up in a rushing river, we\u2019re kicked out of the pond and told by the world to go make something of our lives.\n\nThere are a few problems here. One is that at that moment, you\u2019re kind of skill-less and knowledge-less and a lot of other things-less:\n\nBut before you can even address your general uselessness, there\u2019s an even bigger issue\u2014your pre-set path ended. Kids in school are kind of like employees of a company where someone else is the CEO. But no one is the CEO of your life in the real world, or of your career path\u2014except you. And you\u2019ve spent your whole life becoming a pro student, leaving you with zero experience as the CEO of anything. Up to now, you\u2019ve only been in charge of the micro decisions\u2014\u201dHow do I succeed at my job as a student?\u201d\u2014and now you\u2019re suddenly holding the keys to the macro cockpit as well, tasked with answering stressful macro questions like \u201cWho am I?\u201d and \u201cWhat are the important things in life?\u201d and \u201cWhat are my options for paths and which one should I choose and how do I even make a path?\u201d When we leave school for the last time, the macro guidance we\u2019ve become so accustomed to is suddenly whisked away from us, leaving us standing there holding our respective dicks, with no idea how to do this.\nThen time happens. And we end up on a path. And that path becomes our life\u2019s story.\nAt the end of our life, when we look back at how things went, we can see our life\u2019s path in its entirety, from an aerial view.\nWhen scientists study people on their deathbed and how they feel about their lives, they usually find that many of them feel some serious regrets. I think a lot of those regrets stem from the fact that most of us aren\u2019t really taught about path-making in our childhoods, and most of us also don\u2019t get much better at path-making as adults, which leaves many people looking back on a life path that didn\u2019t really make sense, given who they are and the world they lived in.\nSo this is a post about path-making. Let\u2019s take a 30-minute pre-deathbed pause to look down at the path we\u2019re on, and ahead at where that path seems to be going, and make sure it makes sense.\nThe Cook and the Chef\u2014Revisited\nIn the past, I\u2019ve written about the critical distinction between \u201creasoning from first principles\u201d and \u201creasoning by analogy\u201d\u2014or what I called being a \u201cchef\u201d vs. being a \u201ccook.\u201d Since writing the post, I notice this distinction everywhere, and I\u2019ve thought about it roughly 2 million times in my own life.\nThe idea is that reasoning from first principles is reasoning like a scientist. You take core facts and observations and use them to puzzle together a conclusion, kind of like a chef playing around with raw ingredients to try to make them into something good. By doing this puzzling, a chef eventually writes a new recipe. The other kind of reasoning\u2014reasoning by analogy\u2014happens when you look at the way things are already done and you essentially copy it, with maybe a little personal tweak here and there\u2014kind of like a cook following an already written recipe.\nA pure verbatim recipe-copying cook and a pure independently inventive chef are the two extreme ends of what is, of course, a spectrum. But for any particular part of your life that involves reasoning and decision making, wherever you happen to be on the spectrum, your reasoning process can usually be boiled down to fundamentally chef-like or fundamentally cook-like. Creating vs. copying. Originality vs. conformity.\nBeing a chef takes a tremendous amount of time and energy\u2014which makes sense, because you\u2019re not trying to reinvent the wheel, you\u2019re trying to invent it for the first time. Puzzling your way to a conclusion feels like navigating a mysterious forest while blindfolded and always involves a whole lot of failure, in the form of trial and error. Being a cook is far easier and more straightforward and less icky. In most situations, being a chef is a terrible waste of time, and comes with a high opportunity cost, since time on Earth is immensely scarce. Right now, I\u2019m wearing J. Crew jeans and a plain t-shirt and a hoodie and Allbirds shoes, because I\u2019m trying to conform. Throughout my life, I\u2019ve looked around at people who seem kind of like me and I\u2019ve bought a bunch of clothes that look like what they wear. And this makes sense\u2014because clothes aren\u2019t important to me, and they\u2019re not how I choose to express my individuality. So in my case, fashion is a perfect part of life to use a reasoning shortcut and be a cook.2\nBut then there are those parts of life that are really really deeply important\u2014like where you choose to live, or the kinds of friends you choose to make, or whether you want to get married and to whom, or whether you want to have kids and how you want to raise them, or how you set your lifestyle priorities.\nCareer-path-carving is definitely one of those really really deeply important things. Let\u2019s spell out the obvious reasons why:\nTime. For most of us, a career (including ancillary career time, like time spent commuting and thinking about your work) will eat up somewhere between 50,000 and 150,000 hours. At the moment, a long human life runs at about 750,000 hours. When you subtract childhood (~175,000 hours) and the portion of your adult life you\u2019ll spend sleeping, eating, exercising, and otherwise taking care of the human pet you live in, along with errands and general life upkeep (~325,000 hours), you\u2019re left with 250,000 \u201cmeaningful adult hours.\u201d3 So a typical career will take up somewhere between 20% and 60% of your meaningful adult time\u2014not something to be a cook about.\n\nQuality of Life. Your career has a major effect on all the non-career hours as well. For those of us not already wealthy through past earnings, marriage, or inheritance, a career doubles as our means of support. The particulars of your career also often play a big role in determining where you live, how flexible your life is, the kinds of things you\u2019re able to do in your free time, and sometimes even in who you end up marrying.\nImpact. On top of your career being the way you spend much of your time and the means of support for the rest of your time, your career triples as your primary mode of impact-making. Every human life touches thousands of other lives in thousands of different ways, and all of those lives you alter then go on to touch thousands of lives of their own. We can\u2019t test this, but I\u2019m pretty sure that you can select any 80-year-old alive today, go back in time 80 years, find them as an infant, throw the infant in the trash, and then come back to the present day and find a countless number of things changed. All lives make a large impact on the world and on the future\u2014but the kind of impact you end up making is largely within your control, depending on the values you live by and the places you direct your energy. Whatever shape your career path ends up taking, the world will be altered by it.\nIdentity. In our childhoods, people ask us about our career plans by asking us what we want to be when we grow up. When we grow up, we tell people about our careers by telling them what we are. We don\u2019t say, \u201cI practice law\u201d\u2014we say, \u201cI am a lawyer.\u201d This is probably an unhealthy way to think about careers, but the way many societies are right now, a person\u2019s career quadruples as the person\u2019s primary identity. Which is kind of a big thing.\nSo yeah\u2014your career path isn\u2019t like my shitty sweatshirt. It\u2019s really really deeply important, putting it squarely in \u201cDefinitely absolutely make sure to be a chef about it\u201d territory.\nYour Career Map\nWhich brings us to you. I don\u2019t know exactly what your deal is. But there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re somewhere in one of the blue regions\u2014\n\n\u2014which means your career path is a work in progress.4\nWhether you\u2019re yet to start your career or well into it, somewhere in the back of your mind (or maybe in the very front of it) is a \u201cCareer Plans\u201d map.\nWe can group map holders into three broad categories\u2014each of which is well-represented in the river, in the pond, standing on the shore, and at every stage of adult life.\nOne group of people will look at the map and see a big, stressful question mark.\n\nThese are people who feel indecisive about their career path. They\u2019ve been told to follow their passion, but they don\u2019t feel especially passionate about anything. They\u2019ve been told to let their strengths guide them, but they\u2019re not sure what they\u2019re best at. They may have felt they had answers in the past, but they\u2019ve changed and they\u2019re no longer sure who they are or where they\u2019re going. \nOther people will see a nice clear arrow representing a direction they feel confident is right\u2014but find their legs walking in a different direction. They\u2019re living with one of the most common sources of human misery, a career path they know in their heart is wrong.\n\nThe lucky ones feel they know where they want to go and believe they\u2019re marching in that direction.\n\nBut even these people should pause and ask themselves, \u201cWho actually drew this arrow? Was it really me?\u201d The answer can get confusing.\nI\u2019m pretty sure all of these people would benefit from a moment of career path reflection.\n\nThe Okay But Why Do You Think You Can Help Me With My Career Reflection You Draw Stick Figures for a Living Blue Box\nExtremely fair question. One thing I always ask myself as I pick topics to write about is, \u201cAm I qualified to write about this?\u201d Here are the reasons I decided to take on this topic:\n1) I have spent most of the last 20 years in a perpetual state of analyzing my own career path.\n2) My path has taken a lot of turns\u2014from wanting to be a movie star when I was 7 to wanting to be the president when I was 17 to wanting to write film scores when I was 22 to wanting to be an entrepreneur when I was 24 to wanting to write musicals when I was 29 to most recently wanting to be a writer-ish guy.\n3) After being pretty all over the place about my career path for most of my life, I actually love my job now. That\u2019s always subject to change, but being able to look at the decision-making processes that led me to confusing or frustrating places, side by side with the decisions that led me to a more fulfilling place, has offered me some wisdom on where people tend to go wrong.\n4) On top of having my own story to look at, I\u2019ve had a front-row seat for the stories of my dozen or so closest friends. My friends seem to share my career path obsessiveness, so between observing their paths and talking with them about those paths again and again along the way, I\u2019ve broadened my views on the topic, which helps me to distinguish between the lessons that are my-life specific and those that are more universal.\n5) Finally, this isn\u2019t a post about which careers are better or worse than others or which career values are more or less meaningful\u2014there are lots of social scientists and self-help authors out there with good data on that, and I\u2019m not one of them. It\u2019s instead a framework that I think can help a career-path reflector better see their own situation, and what really matters to them, clearly and honestly. This framework has worked really well for me, so I think it can probably be helpful for other people too.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve taken a fresh look at your Career Plans map, along with whatever arrow may or may not be on it, put it down and out of sight. We\u2019ll come back to it at the end of the post. It\u2019s time now for a deep dive\u2014let\u2019s think about this from scratch. From first principles.\n___________\nIn the cook-chef post, I designed a simple framework for how a chef makes major career choices. At its core is a simple Venn diagram.\nThe first part of the diagram is the Want Box, which contains all the careers you find desirable.\n\nThe second part of the diagram is the Reality Box. The Reality Box is for the set of all careers that are realistic to potentially achieve\u2014based on a comparison, in each case, between your level of potential in an area and the general difficulty of achieving success in that area.\n\nThe overlapping area contains your optimal career path choices\u2014the set of arrows you should consider drawing on your Career Map. We can call it the Option Pool.\n\nThis is straightforward enough. But actually filling in these boxes accurately is way harder than it looks. For the diagram to work, it has to be as close to the truth as possible, and to get there, we have to lift up the hood of our subconscious and head down. Let\u2019s start with the Want Box.\nDeep Analysis, Part 1: Your Want Box\nThe hard thing about the Want Box is that you want a bunch of different things\u2014or, rather, there are a bunch of different sides of you, and each of them wants\u2014and fears\u2014its own stuff. And since some motivations have conflicting interests with others, you cannot, by definition, have everything you want. Going for one thing you want means, by definition, not going for others, and sometimes, it\u2019ll specifically mean going directly against others. The Want Box is a game of compromise.\nThe Yearning Octopus\nTo do a proper Want Box audit, you need to think about what you yearn for in a career and then unpack the shit out of it. Luckily, we have someone here who can help us. The Yearning Octopus.\n\nWe each have our own personal Yearning Octopus5 in our heads. The particulars of each person\u2019s Yearning Octopus will vary, but people also aren\u2019t all that different from each other, and I bet many of us feel very similar yearnings and fears (especially given that I find that Wait But Why readers tend to have a lot in common).\nThe first thing to think about is that there are totally distinct yearning worlds\u2014each living on one tentacle. These tentacles often do not get along with each other.\n\n\nIt gets worse. Each tentacle is made up of a bunch of different individual yearnings and their accompanying fears\u2014and these often massively conflict with each other too.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at each tentacle to see what\u2019s going on.\n\nThe Personal Yearnings tentacle is probably the hardest one to generalize here\u2014it\u2019s pretty particular to each of us. It\u2019s a reflection of our specific personality and our values, and it bears the burden of probably the most complex and challenging human need: fulfillment. It\u2019s also in the shit dealing with not only our current selves, but a bunch of our past selves too. The dreams of 7-year-old you and the idealized identity of 12-year-old you and the secret hopes of 17-year-old you and the evolving passions of your current self are all somewhere on the personal tentacle, each throwing their own little fit about getting what they want, and each fully ready to make you feel horrible about yourself with their disappointment and disgust if you fail them. On top of that, your fear of death sometimes emerges on the personal tentacle, all needy about you leaving your mark and achieving greatness and all that. The personal tentacle is why you don\u2019t find very many billionaires content to spend the rest of their life sipping cocktails on the beach\u2014it\u2019s a highly needy tentacle.\nAnd yet, the personal tentacle is also one that often ends up somewhat neglected. Because in many cases, it\u2019s the ickiest set of yearnings to really go for; because the fears of this tentacle aren\u2019t scary in an immediate way\u2014they creep in out of the background over time; and because the personal tentacle is always at risk of getting bowled over early in your career by the powerful animal emotions of the other tentacles. This neglect can leave a person with major regrets later on once the dust settles. An unfulfilled Personal Yearnings tentacle is often the explanation, for example, behind a very successful, very unhappy person\u2014who may believe they got successful in the wrong field.\n\nThe Social Yearnings tentacle is probably our most primitive, animal side, with its core drive stemming back to our tribal evolutionary past. On the tentacle are a number of odd creatures.\nAs we\u2019ve discussed before on this blog, we all have a Social Survival Mammoth living in our heads who\u2019s earth-shatteringly obsessed with what other people think of us. This means he craves acceptance and inclusion and being well-liked, while likewise being petrified of embarrassment, negative judgment, and disapproval. He really really really wants to be in the in-group and he really really really doesn\u2019t want to be in the outgroup. He\u2019s quite cute though.\nThen there\u2019s your ego, who\u2019s a similar character but even more needy. Your ego doesn\u2019t just want to be accepted; it wants to be admired, desired, and fawned upon\u2014ideally, on a mass scale. More upsetting to it than being disliked is being ignored. It wants to be relevant and important and widely known.\nThere are other characters milling about as well. Somewhere else on the social tentacle is a little judge with a little gavel who gets very butthurt if it thinks people aren\u2019t judging you fairly\u2014if you\u2019re not appropriately appreciated. It\u2019s very important to the judge that people are aware of exactly how smart and talented you think you are. The judge is also big on holding grudges\u2014which is the reason a lot of people are driven more than anything by a desire to show that person or those people who never believed in them.\nFinally, some of us may find a loving little dog on our social tentacle who wants more than anything in the world to please its owner, and who just cannot bear the thought of disappointing them. The one problem with this adorable creature is that its owner isn\u2019t you. It\u2019s a person with so much psychological power over you that, if you\u2019re not careful, you may dedicate your whole career to trying to please them and make them proud. (It\u2019s probably a parent.)\n\nThe Lifestyle Yearnings tentacle mostly just wants Tuesday to be a good day. But like, a really pleasant, enjoyable day\u2014with plenty of free time and self-care and relaxation and luxuries.\nIt\u2019s also concerned with your life in the big picture being as great as possible\u2014as far as your lifestyle tentacle is concerned, you should be able to do what you want to do in life, when and how you want to do it, with the people you like most. Life should be full of fun times and rich experiences, but it should also roll by smoothly, without too much hard work and as few bumps in the road as possible.\nThe issue is, even if you place a high priority on your lifestyle yearnings, it\u2019s pretty difficult to keep the whole tentacle happy at the same time. The part of the tentacle that just wants to sit around and relax will hold you back from sweating to build the kind of career that offers long-term flexibility and the kind of wealth that can make life luxurious and cushy and full of toys. The part of the tentacle that only feels comfortable when the future feels predictable will reject the exact kinds of paths that may generate the long-term freedom another part of the tentacle longs for. The side of you that wants a stress-free life doesn\u2019t get along very well with the side of you that thirsts to be hang gliding off a cliff in Namibia like Richard Branson.\n\nThe Moral Yearnings tentacle thinks the rest of the tentacles of your Yearning Octopus are a real pack of dicks\u2014each one more self-involved and self-indulgent than the next. The parts of you on the moral tentacle look around and see a big world that needs so much fixing; they see billions of people no less worthy than you of a good life who just happened to be born into inferior circumstances; they see an uncertain future ahead that hangs in the balance between utopia and dystopia for life on Earth\u2014a future we can actually push in the right direction if we could only get our other tentacles out of our way. While the other tentacles fantasize about what you would do with your life if you had a billion dollars in the bank, the moral tentacle fantasizes about the kind of impact you could make if you had a billion dollars to deploy.\nNeedless to say, the other tentacles of your Yearning Octopus find the moral tentacle to be insufferable. They also can\u2019t begin to understand philanthropy for philanthropy\u2019s sake\u2014they think, \u201cOther people aren\u2019t me, so why would I spend my time and energy working to help them?\u201d\u2014but they can understand philanthropy for their own motive\u2019s sake. While the moral and lifestyle tentacles tend to be in direct conflict, others may sometimes find common ground\u2014the social tentacle can get very into philanthropy if it\u2019ll happen to win you respect and admiration from a highly regarded social group, and some people\u2019s personal tentacle may find the meaning or self-worth it so craves in a philanthropic endeavor.\nThat\u2019s why, when you do something philanthropic\u2014or anything altruistic, really\u2014there are a few separate things going on in your head. The part of you determined to get proper public credit for the deed lives on your social tentacle; the part of you that thinks \u201cGod I\u2019m a good person\u201d lives on your personal tentacle; and the part of you that really loves seeing the person or group you helped be better off lives on your moral tentacle. Likewise, not doing anything for others can hurt you on multiple tentacles\u2014the moral tentacle because it feels guilty and sad, the social tentacle because this may cause others to judge you as a selfish or greedy person, and the personal tentacle because it may lower your self-esteem.\n\nYour Practical Yearnings tentacle thinks all of this is fine and great\u2014but it would also like to point out that it\u2019s March 31st and your rent is due tomorrow, and the funny thing about that is that it logged into your bank account and saw that the number of dollars in it is actually less than the number of dollars that your landlord will need from you sometime in the next 34 hours. And yeah it knows that you deposited that check on Thursday and that it\u2019s supposed to clear tomorrow morning, but your practical tentacle also could have sworn that just last month, all the tentacles promised that they\u2019d make some sacrifices in order to build up at least a little bank account cushion so that simply paying the rent wouldn\u2019t have to be really fucking stressful every month. Your practical tentacle also can\u2019t help but notice that your social tentacle offered to buy a round of drinks for all nine people you went to the bar with last Saturday so those people would think of you as a classy, generous person, and that your lifestyle tentacle chose to rent what sure seems like a pretty nice-ass apartment for someone now living check to check, and that the updates have gotten real quiet from your friend about that bagel delivery service he started six months ago that your moral tentacle happily invested $2,500 in to help it get off the ground, and oh also that meanwhile your personal tentacle has everyone sweating their dick off working at two comedy-writing internships simultaneously that somehow manage to bring in less money combined than you made dressing up as an Egyptian enchantress to wait tables at Jekyll & Hyde sophomore year of college.\nAt its basic level, your practical tentacle wants to make sure you can eat food and wear clothes and buy the medicine you need and not live outside. It doesn\u2019t really care how these things happen\u2014it just wants them to happen. But then everyone else on the octopus makes your practical tentacle\u2019s life super hard by being fucky about things. Every time your income goes up, your lifestyle tentacle decides to raise the bar on what it wants and expects, leaving your practical tentacle continually in the shit trying to cover it all so you don\u2019t have to run up your credit card debt. Your personal tentacle has all of these weird needs that take up a lot of time and more often than not aren\u2019t exactly big money-makers. And while your practical tentacle would be totally down to just ask your rich uncle for money to help out, your social tentacle outlawed asking others for money because \u201cit\u2019s not a good look,\u201d with your personal tentacle chiming in that \u201cyeah, we\u2019re better than that.\u201d\nSo that\u2019s the situation. You\u2019ve got this Yearning Octopus in your head with five tentacles (or however many yours has), each with their own agenda, that often conflict with each other. Then there are the distinct individual yearnings on each tentacle, often in conflict amongst themselves. And if that weren\u2019t enough, you sometimes have furious internal conflict inside a single yearning. Like when your desire to pursue your passion can\u2019t figure out what it\u2019s most passionate about.\n\nOr when you want so badly to be respected, but then you remember that a career that wins the undying respect of one segment of society will always receive shrugs from other segments and even contemptuous eye rolls from other segments still.\nOr when you decide to satisfy your urge to help others, before realizing that the part of you that wants to dedicate your life to helping to mitigate humanity\u2019s greatest existential risks has palpable disdain for the part of you that would rather make a tangible positive impact on your local community\u2014while the part of you that can\u2019t stand the thought of the millions of today\u2019s humans without access to clean water finds both of those other yearnings to be pretty cold and heartless.\nSo yeah, your Yearning Octopus is complicated. And no human in history has ever satisfied their entire octopus\u2014that\u2019s why you\u2019ll never find it fully smiling. Human yearning is a game of choices and sacrifices and compromise.\nDissecting the Octopus\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s return to your Want Box. When we think about our career goals and fears and hopes and dreams, our consciousness is just accessing the net output of the Yearning Octopus\u2014which is usually made up of its loudest voices. Only by digging into our mind\u2019s subconscious can we see what\u2019s really going on.6\nThe cool thing is that we all have the ability to do that. The stuff in your subconscious is like stuff in the basement of a house. It\u2019s not off-limits to us\u2014it\u2019s just in the basement. We can go look at it anytime\u2014we just have to A) remember that the house has a basement, and B) actually spend the time and energy to go down there, even though going down there might suck.\nSo let\u2019s head to the basement of your mind to look for the octopus. Unless you\u2019re one of those people who\u2019s really practiced at analyzing your subconscious, it might be dark in the basement, making it hard to see your octopus. The way to start turning the lights on is by identifying what your conscious mind currently knows about your yearnings and fears, and then unpacking it.\nLike if there\u2019s a certain career path that sounds fantastic to you, unpack that. Which tentacles in particular are yearning for that career\u2014and which specific parts of those tentacles?\nIf you\u2019re not currently working towards that career you supposedly yearn for, try to figure out why not. If you think it\u2019s because you\u2019re afraid of failing, unpack that. Fear of failure can emerge from any of the tentacles, so that\u2019s not a specific enough analysis. You want to find the specific source of the fear. Is it a social tentacle fear of embarrassment, or of being judged by others as not that smart, or of appearing to be not that successful to your romantic interests? Is it a personal tentacle fear of damaging your own self-image\u2014of confirming a suspicion about yourself that haunts you? Is it a lifestyle tentacle fear of having to downgrade your living situation, or of bringing stress and instability into a currently predictable life? Or maybe that fear of a living situation downgrade isn\u2019t actually emerging from your lifestyle tentacle, but more so from your social tentacle\u2014in other words, is it possible you\u2019re indifferent about the apartment change itself but super concerned about the message a lifestyle downgrade sends to your friends and family? Or are there financial commitments you simply cannot back out of at the moment, and your practical tentacle is in a genuine panic about how you\u2019ll make ends meet should this career switch take longer than expected to work out, or not work out at all? Or are a few of these combining together to generate your fear of making the leap?\nPerhaps you don\u2019t really think it\u2019s fear of failure that\u2019s stopping you, but something else. Maybe it\u2019s a dread of the change in identity\u2014both internally and externally\u2014that inevitably accompanies a career move like this. Maybe it\u2019s the heavy weight of inertia\u2014an intense resistance to change\u2014that seems to exist in and of itself and overpowers all of your other yearnings. In either case, you\u2019d want to unpack the feeling and ask yourself exactly which tentacles are so opposed to an identity shift, or so driven by inertia.\nMaybe you pine to be rich. You fantasize about a life where you make $1.2 million a year, and you feel a tremendous drive to make it happen. All five tentacles can feel a desire for wealth under certain circumstances, each for their own reasons. Unpack it.\nAs you unpack an inner drive to make money, maybe you discover that at its core, the drive is more for a sense of security than for vast wealth. That can be unpacked too. A yearning for security at its simplest is just your practical tentacle doing what your practical tentacle does. But maybe it\u2019s not actually basic security you want as much as a guarantee of a certain level of fanciness demanded by your lifestyle or social tentacle. Or perhaps what you really want is a level of security so over-the-top secure it can no longer be called a security yearning\u2014instead, it may be an impulse by the emotional well-being section of your lifestyle tentacle to alleviate a compulsive financial stress you were raised to forever feel, almost regardless of your actual financial situation.\nThe answers to all of these questions lie somewhere on the tentacles of your Yearning Octopus. And by asking questions like these and digging deep enough to identify the true roots of your various yearnings, you start to turn on the basement light and acquaint yourself with your octopus in all its complexity.\nYou\u2019ll also come to understand which of your inner yearnings seem to speak the loudest in your mind and carry the most pull in your decision-making processes. Pretty quickly, a yearning hierarchy will begin to reveal itself. You\u2019ll identify yearnings that speak loudly and get their way; yearnings that cry at the top of their lungs but get continually elbowed out of the way by higher-prioritized parts of the octopus; yearnings that seem resigned to their low-status positions in the hierarchy.\nSearching for Imposters\nWe\u2019re making good progress\u2014but we\u2019re just getting started. Once you have a reasonably clear picture of your Yearning Octopus, you can start doing the real work\u2014work that takes place another level down in your subconscious, in the basement of the basement. Here, you can set up a little interrogation room and one by one, bring each yearning down into it for a cross-examination.\nYou\u2019ll start by asking each yearning: how did you end up here, and why are you the way you are? Desires, beliefs, values, and fears don\u2019t materialize out of nowhere. They\u2019re either developed over time by our internal consciousness as observations and life experience pour in, or they\u2019re implanted in us from the outside, by someone else. In other words, they\u2019re the product of either you the chef or you the cook.\nSo the goal here in your creepy interrogation room is to tug on the faces of each of your yearnings to find out if it\u2019s authentically you, or if it\u2019s someone else disguised as you.\nYou can pull on a yearning\u2019s face by playing the Why Game. You\u2019ll ask your initial Why\u2014Why is this something I want?\u2014and get to some kind of Because. Then you\u2019ll keep going. Why did that particular Because lead you to want what you now want? And when did that particular Because gain so much gravity with you? You\u2019ll get to a deeper Because behind the Because. And if you continue with this, you\u2019ll usually discover one of three things:\n1) You\u2019ll trace the Why back to its origin and reveal a long chain of authentic evolution that developed through deep independent thought. You\u2019ll pull on their face and confirm that the skin is real.\n2) You\u2019ll trace the Why back to an original Because that someone else installed in you\u2014I guess the only reason I actually have this value is because my mom kind of forced it on me\u2014and you realize that you never really thought to consider whether you actually independently agree with it. You never stopped to ask yourself whether your own accumulated wisdom actually justifies the level of conviction you feel about that core belief. In a case like this, the yearning is revealed to be an imposter pretending to be an authentic yearning of yours. You pull on its face and it\u2019s a mask that comes off, exposing the yearning\u2019s original installer underneath.\n3) You\u2019ll trace the Why back and back and get kind of lost in a haze of \u201cI guess I just know this because it\u2019s true!\u201d This could be an authentic you thing, or just another version of #2, in an instance where you can\u2019t recall the moment this feeling was installed in you. Somewhere deep in you, you\u2019ll have a hunch about which it is.\nIn a #1 scenario, you can be proud that you developed that part of you like a chef. It\u2019s an authentic and hard-earned feeling or value.\nIn a #2 or maybe #3 scenario, you\u2019ve discovered that you\u2019ve been duped. You\u2019ve let someone else sneak onto your Yearning Octopus while you weren\u2019t looking. When it comes to that particular belief of yours, you\u2019re a cook following someone else\u2019s recipe\u2014an obedient robot reciting desires and fears out of someone else\u2019s brain.\nThere\u2019s a chance you\u2019re an unusually wise person whose examination reveals an octopus developed mostly by you and kept readily up to date. More likely, you\u2019re like me and most of my friends\u2014your interrogation room reveals some definite imposters, or at least a lot of ambiguity. Like, underneath one mask, you\u2019ll find your mom.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll pull off others to reveal the values and judgments of broader conventional wisdom, or the viewpoints of your more immediate community, or what\u2019s considered cool by the dominant culture of your generation or the immediate culture within your closest group of friends.\n\nSometimes you\u2019ll get to the end of a Why-Because pathway only to find the philosophy in a famous novel, or something a celebrity hero of yours once said in an interview, or a strong opinion one of your professors always repeated.\nYou might even find that some of your yearnings and fears were written by you\u2026when you were seven years old. Like a childhood dream that was etched into the back of your consciousness as the thing you believe you really want, when you\u2019re being truly honest.\n\n\nThe interrogation room probably won\u2019t be that fun a time. But it\u2019s time well spent\u2014because you\u2019re not your 7-year-old self, just like you\u2019re not your parents or your friends or your generation or your society or your heroes or your past decisions or your recent circumstances. You\u2019re Current-Age You\u2014the only person, and the only version of yourself, who is actually qualified to want and not want the things you want and don\u2019t want.\nTo be clear, this isn\u2019t to say that it\u2019s wrong to live by the words of a wise parent or a famous philosopher or friends you respect or the convictions of a younger you. Humble people are by definition influence-able\u2014influences are an important and inevitable part of who each of us is. The key distinction is this:\nDo you treat the words of your external influences as information, held and considered by an authentic inner you, that you\u2019ve carefully decided to embrace? Or are your influences themselves actually in your brain, masquerading as inner you?\nDo you want the same thing someone else you know wants because you heard them talk about it, you thought about it alongside your own life experience, and you eventually decided that, for now, you agree? Or because you heard someone talk about what they want or fear, and you thought, \u201cI don\u2019t know shit and that person does, so if they say X is true, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re right\u201d\u2014and then you etched those ideas into your mind, never again feeling the need to question them?\nThe former is what chefs do. The latter is what you do when you\u2019re being an obedient robot. And a robot is what you become when at some point you get the idea in your head that someone else is more qualified to be you than you are.\nThe good news is that all humans make this mistake\u2014and you can fix it. Just like your subconscious is right there for viewing if you want to view it\u2014it\u2019s also there for changing and updating and rewriting. It\u2019s your head\u2014you\u2019re allowed to do with it what you want.\nSo it\u2019s time for some evictions. Masked imposters have to go. Even mom and dad.\nAt the end of this, your octopus may look a little barren, leaving you feeling a little like you don\u2019t know who you even are anymore. We usually think of this as a bad feeling, or even an existential crisis, but it actually means you\u2019re doing better than most people.\n\nThe drop from naive over-confidence to wise, realistic humility never feels good, but pausing the roller coaster while it\u2019s still on that first cliff and avoiding the pain\u2014which turns out to be a lot of people\u2019s move\u2014isn\u2019t a great strategy. Wisdom isn\u2019t correlated with knowledge, it\u2019s correlated with being in touch with reality\u2014it\u2019s not how far to the right you are on the graph, it\u2019s how close you are to the orange line. Wisdom hurts at first, but it\u2019s the only place where actual growth happens. The irony is that the cliff-pausers of the world like to make the wiser, braver valley-dwellers or continual-climbers feel bad about themselves\u2014because they fundamentally don\u2019t get how knowing yourself works. They haven\u2019t reached that stage yet.\nGetting to know your real self is super hard and never complete. But if you\u2019ve tumbled off the cliff, you\u2019ve gone through a key rite of passage and progress is now possible. As you climb up the orange line, you\u2019ll slowly but surely begin to repopulate your Yearning Octopus with your real self.\nAt the moment, it probably won\u2019t be obvious what those missing yearnings of yours are exactly\u2014because they\u2019re on an even deeper floor of your subconscious. They\u2019re in the basement of the basement of the basement\u2014in a place called Denial Prison.\nDenial Prison\nOur brain\u2019s Denial Prison is a place most of us don\u2019t even know is there\u2014it\u2019s where we put the parts of us we repress and deny.\nThe authentic yearnings of ours that we\u2019re in touch with\u2014i.e. those that proved to be authentic during interrogation\u2014were easy parts of our true selves to find in our subconscious, lying in plain sight, right below the surface of our consciousness. Even our conscious mind knows these yearnings well, because they frequently make their way upstairs into our thoughts. These are the parts of us we have a healthy relationship with.\nBut then there are the parts of you that weren\u2019t living on your octopus where they\u2019re supposed to be\u2014instead, you found an imposter in their place. These lost parts of you are often incredibly hard to access, because they\u2019ve been living deep in your subconscious, on a floor so low it\u2019s almost not there at all. Almost.\nSome parts of us are banished down on basement #3 because they\u2019re extraordinarily painful for us to acknowledge or think about. Sometimes new parts of us are born only to be immediately locked up in prison as part of a denial of our own evolution\u2014i.e. out of stubbornness. But there are other times when a part of us is in Denial Prison because someone else locked it up down there. In the case of your yearnings, some of them will have been put there by whatever masked intruder had been taking its place. If dad has successfully convinced you that you care deeply about having a prestigious career, he probably has also convinced you that the part of you that, deep down, really wants to be a carpenter isn\u2019t really you and isn\u2019t what you really want. At some point during your childhood, he threw your passion for carpentry into a dark, dank Denial Prison cell.\nSo let\u2019s gather your courage and head down to the basement of the basement of the basement of your mind and see what we find.\n\nYou may pass some unpleasant characters.\n\nLeave them for another time\u2014right now, search for locked-away career-related yearnings. Maybe you\u2019ll find a repressed passion to teach. Or a desire to be famous that your particular tribe has shamed you out of. Or a deep love of long blocks of free, open leisure time that your hornier, greedier teenage self kicked downstairs in favor of a raging ambition.\nThere will be certain parts of your authentic self you won\u2019t be able to uncover in Denial Prison\u2014it\u2019s pretty dark down there. But be patient\u2014now that you\u2019ve done your audit and cleared space for them on your octopus, they may begin to emerge.\nPriority Rankings\nThe other part of our Yearning Octopus audit will address the hierarchy of your yearnings. Almost as important as the yearnings themselves is the priority they\u2019re given. The hierarchy is easy to see because it\u2019s revealed in your actions. You may like to think a desire to do something bold is high up on your hierarchy, but if you\u2019re not currently working on something bold, it reveals that however important boldness is to you, something else\u2014some source of fear or inertia in you\u2014is currently being prioritized above it.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that a ranking of yearnings is also a ranking of fears. The octopus contains anything that could make you want or not want to pursue a certain career, and the reverse side of each yearning is its accompanying fear of the opposite. The reverse side of your yearning to be admired is a fear of embarrassment. If you flip over your desire for self-actualization, you\u2019ll see a fear of underachieving. The other half of your craving of self-esteem is a fear of feeling shame. If your actions don\u2019t seem to match what you believe is the internal hierarchy of your yearnings, usually it\u2019s because you\u2019re forgetting to think about the role your fears are playing. What looks like a determined drive for success, for example, might actually be someone running away from a negative self-image or trying to escape feelings like envy or under-appreciation. If your actions seem beholden to yearnings that you don\u2019t believe you actually care that much about, you\u2019re probably not looking closely enough at your fears.\nWith both yearnings and fears in mind, think about what your internal hierarchy might look like, and return that same important question: \u201cWho made this order? Was it really me?\u201d\nFor example, we\u2019re often told to \u201cfollow our passion\u201d\u2014this is society saying \u201cput your passion yearnings at the top of your hierarchy.\u201d That\u2019s a very specific instruction. Maybe that\u2019s the right thing for you, but it also very well might not be. It\u2019s something you need to independently evaluate.\nTo get this right, let\u2019s try to do a fresh ranking, from first principles, based on who we really are, how we\u2019ve evolved over time, and what really matters to us most, right now.\nThis isn\u2019t about which yearnings or fears have the loudest voices or which fears are most palpable\u2014if it were, you\u2019d be letting your impulses take the wheel of your life. The person doing the ranking is you\u2014the little center of consciousness reading this post who can observe your octopus and look at it objectively. This involves another kind of compromise. On one side, you\u2019ll try to tap into all the wisdom you\u2019ve accumulated throughout your life and make active decisions about values\u2014about what you really believe is important. On the other side, it\u2019s about self-acceptance and self-compassion. Sometimes you\u2019ll have strong undeniable yearnings that you\u2019re not super proud of\u2014whether you like it or not, those are part of you, and when you neglect them, they may cause a continual stink and make you miserable. Creating your yearning hierarchy is a give and take between what\u2019s important and what\u2019s you. It\u2019s probably a good goal to give higher priority to your more noble qualities, but it\u2019s okay to throw a bone to some of your not-so-noble sides as well\u2014depending on where you decide to draw the line. There\u2019s a wisdom to knowing when to accept your not-so-noble side and when to reject it entirely.\nTo get all of this in order, we want a good system. You can play around with what works for you\u2014I like the idea of a shelf:\n\nThis divides things into five categories. The absolutely highest priority inner drives get to go in the extra special non-negotiable bowl. The NN bowl is for yearnings so important to you that you want to essentially guarantee that they\u2019ll happen\u2014at the expense of all other yearnings, if necessary. This is why so many of history\u2019s legends were famously single-minded\u2014they had a very intense NN bowl yearning and it led them to world fame, often at the expense of relationships, balance, and health. The bowl is small because it should be used very sparingly\u2014if at all. Like maybe only one thing gets it. Or maybe two or three. Too many things in the NN bowl cancels out its power, making that the same as having nothing in the bowl at all. \nYour group of top shelf yearnings is mostly what will drive your career choices\u2014but top shelf placement should also be doled out sparingly (that\u2019s why it\u2019s not a very large shelf). Shelf placement is as much about de-prioritizing as it is about prioritizing. You\u2019re not just choosing which parts of you are the most important to make you happy, you\u2019re choosing which parts of you to intentionally leave wanting or even directly opposed. No matter what your hierarchy looks like, some yearnings will be left feeling very unhappy and some fears will feel like they\u2019re being continually assaulted. This is inevitable.\nThat\u2019s why most yearnings should be on the middle shelf, the bottom shelf, or the trash can. The middle shelf is good for those not-so-noble qualities in you that you decide to accept. They deserve some of your attention. And they\u2019ll often demand it\u2014core parts of you won\u2019t go quietly into non-prioritization, and they sometimes can really ruin your life if they\u2019re neglected.\nMost of the rest will end up on the bottom shelf. Putting a part of you on the bottom shelf is telling it, \u201cI know you want these things, but for now, I\u2019ve decided other things are more important. I promise to revisit you a little later, after I\u2019ve gotten some more information, and if I change my mind, you\u2019ll get a shelf upgrade then.\u201d The best way to think of the bottom shelf is this: the more yearnings you can convince to accept a bottom shelf rating, the better the chances your top shelf and NN bowl yearnings have of getting what they want. Likewise, the fewer yearnings you put on the top shelf, the more likely those on the top shelf will be to thrive. Your time and energy are severely limited, so this is a zero-sum compromise. The amateur mistake is to be too liberal with the NN bowl and top shelf and too sparing with the large bottom shelf.\nThen there\u2019s the trash can, for the drives and fears you flat-out reject\u2014those parts of you that fundamentally violate the person your wisest self wants to be. A good amount of inner conflict emerges from people\u2019s trash cans, and trash can control is a major component of integrity and inner strength. But like the rest of your hierarchy decisions, your criteria for what qualifies as trash should be derived from your own deep thought, not from what others tell you is and is not trash.\nAs you go through this difficult prioritizing process\u2014inevitably, at times, against the screaming protests of unhappily deprioritized yearnings\u2014remember that you\u2019re the only wise one in the room. Yearnings and fears are impatient and bad at seeing the big picture. Even a seemingly high-minded yearning, like those on the moral tentacle, can\u2019t understand the complete picture in the way you can. Many of the people who have done wonders to make the world better got there on a path that started with selfish motives like wealth or personal fulfillment\u2014motives their moral tentacle probably hated at first. The octopus won\u2019t be the wise adult in the room\u2014that\u2019s your job.\n\nFinally, as we\u2019ll discuss more later, this is not a permanent decision. It\u2019s the opposite\u2014it\u2019s a rough draft written in light pencil. It\u2019s a hypothesis that you\u2019ll be able to test and then revise based on how actually living this hierarchy feels in practice.\nYour Want Box is ready to go. Now let\u2019s turn to your Reality Box.\nDeep Analysis, Part 2: Your Reality Box\nThe Want Box deals with what you find desirable. The Reality Box deals with what\u2019s possible.\nBut when we examined the Want Box, it became clear that it\u2019s not necessarily based on what you actually want\u2014it\u2019s based on what you think you want\u2014what you\u2019re in the habit of wanting.\nThe Reality Box is the same deal. It doesn\u2019t show you reality, it shows your best crack at what reality might be\u2014your perception of reality.\nThe goal of self-reflection is to bring both of these boxes as close to accuracy as possible. We want our perceived yearnings to be a true reflection of our authentic inner selves, and we want our beliefs about what\u2019s possible to come close to mirroring what\u2019s actually possible. For our Want Box audit, we looked under the hood of the Want Box and found its settings\u2014your yearnings and fears. When we open the hood of your Reality Box, we see a group of beliefs.\nWhen it comes to your career possibilities, you\u2019re dealing with two sets of beliefs: beliefs about the world and beliefs about your own potential. For a career option to qualify for your Reality Box, your potential in that career area has to measure up to the objective difficulty of achieving success in that area.\nUs being us, we\u2019re probably pretty bad at assessing either side of this comparison accurately.\nI don\u2019t know how you think about career path difficulty, but in my experience, people often see it like this:\nThere are traditional careers\u2014stuff like medicine or law or teaching or a corporate ladder, etc.\u2014and these careers have predictable, set paths. If you\u2019re decently smart and work hard, you\u2019ll end up in a successful, stable situation.\nThen there are less traditional careers\u2014the arts, entrepreneurship, non-profit work, politics, etc.\u2014and these are wildcards. Success and stability are no guarantee, and to reach great heights, it\u2019s either a lottery ticket game of luck, a genetic lottery game of innate talent, or some combination of the two.\nThese are perfectly reasonable assumptions\u2014if you live in 1952. Your beliefs about the world of careers and about what it takes to succeed need just as thorough an unmasking as your yearnings did\u2014and I suspect that behind most of them, you\u2019ll find big, fat conventional wisdom. You might first pull off the mask of one of your beliefs and find your parents or your friends or your college career coach\u2014but if you keep going and pull on their face, you\u2019ll usually see that it\u2019s also a mask, and conventional wisdom is there hiding behind it. A general conception, a common opinion, an oft-cited statistic7\u2014none of which have actually been verified by you, but all of which are treated as gospel by society.\nToday\u2019s world goes through dramatic changes each decade, which usually leaves conventional wisdom wildly outdated. But we\u2019re wired for a more ancient world where almost nothing ever changed, so we all reason like cooks and treat conventional wisdom as equivalent to truth.\nThese problems then extend to how we view our own potential. When you overrate the impact of innate talent on how people fare in their careers\u2014and you also conflate talent and skill level\u2014it won\u2019t leave you feeling great about your chances at many paths. Because we better understand the trajectory of traditional careers, we\u2019re less prone to do this with them. A first-year medical student sees an experienced surgeon at work and thinks, \u201cI can get there one day\u2014just need to do about 20 years of hard work.\u201d But when a young artist or entrepreneur or software engineer looks at the equivalent of the experienced surgeon in their field, they\u2019re more likely to think, \u201cWow look how talented they are\u2014I\u2019m nowhere near that good,\u201d and get all hopeless. There\u2019s also the other common notion, that people who thrive in non-traditional careers had some \u201cbig break\u201d at some point, like hitting a lucky scratch card jackpot\u2014and I don\u2019t know many people who want to risk their careers on scratch cards.\nThese are only a few examples of the slew of delusions and misconceptions we tend to have about how great careers happen. So let\u2019s brainstorm how it might actually work:\nThe Career Landscape\nI have no idea, mostly. And I think most people have no idea. Things are just changing too quickly.\nBut that\u2019s kind of the key point. If you can figure out how to get a reasonably accurate picture of the real career landscape out there, you have a massive edge over everyone else, most of whom will be using conventional wisdom as their instruction booklet.\nFirst, there\u2019s the broad landscape\u2014the set of all the jobs someone could possibly have in today\u2019s society. My current job description is: \u201cWriter of 8,000-to-40,000-word articles about a bunch of different topics, with cursing and stick figures, on a remarkably sporadic schedule.\u201d Think conventional wisdom has any job openings for me with that description? The landscape today is made up of thousands of options\u2014some 40 years old, some made possible only three months ago because of the advent of some new technology\u2014and the way things work today, if there\u2019s an option you want that\u2019s not already out there, you can probably create it for yourself. Pretty stressful, but also incredibly exciting.\nThen, there\u2019s each specific career path. A career path is like a game board. The conventional wisdom bookshelf contains instruction booklets for only a small fraction of today\u2019s available game boards\u2014and those that it does have usually tell you how that game was played in the past, even though the current game board has evolved significantly into something with new kinds of opportunities and different rules and loopholes. When you consider a career path today, to make an accurate assessment of what the path looks like and what kinds of strength-weakness profiles it favors, you have to understand what that career\u2019s current game board looks like. Otherwise, it\u2019s like trying to evaluate your chances of being a professional basketball player based on your height and strength without realizing that, say, basketball has evolved and is now played on oversize courts that contain 10 different 7-foot hoops, and the current game favors speed over height and strength.\nThis is promising news. There are likely dozens of awesome career paths that beautifully match your natural strengths, and it\u2019s likely that most other people trying to succeed on those paths are playing with an outdated rulebook and strategy guide. If you simply understand what the game board really looks like and play by modern rules, you have a huge advantage.\nYour Potential\nAnd this brings us to you and your particular strengths. Not only do we assess our strengths based on the wrong game boards (like in our basketball example)\u2014even when we have the right game board in mind, we\u2019re often bad at identifying the real strengths that that game calls for.\nWhen assessing your chances on a certain career path, the key question is:\nWith enough time, could you get good enough at this game to potentially reach whatever your definition of success is in that career?\nI like to view this journey to \u201cgood enough at the game to succeed\u201d as a distance. The distance starts with where you are now\u2014point A\u2014and ends with you reaching your definition of success, which we can draw with a star.\n\nThe length of the distance depends on where point A is (how far along you are at the current moment) and where the star is (how lofty your definition of success is).\nSo if you\u2019re a college graduate who majored in computer science and your career goal is to be a middle-of-the-ladder engineer at Google, your distance might look like this:\n\nBut if you\u2019ve never done any kind of computer science before, and your career goal is to be the top engineer at Google, you\u2019ve got a much longer road ahead:\n\nIf your goal is to create the new Google, the road gets much, much longer.\n\nAt this point, conventional wisdom might emerge as a voice in your head and point out that simply getting good enough at a certain skill doesn\u2019t actually guarantee success\u2014you might reach the star on a career path and still find that you haven\u2019t \u201cmade it\u201d yet.\nThat\u2019s mostly wrong, because it\u2019s misunderstanding the star. The star isn\u2019t about a particular skill level\u2014e.g. coding ability or acting skills or business savvy\u2014it\u2019s about the entire game. In traditional careers, the games tend to be more straightforward\u2014if you want to be a top surgeon, and you get incredibly good at surgery, you\u2019ve probably hit your star and you\u2019ll have your career. But the game boards in less traditional careers often involve many more factors. Reaching the \u201cI want to be a famous actor\u201d star doesn\u2019t simply mean getting as good at acting as Morgan Freeman, it means getting as good at the entire actor game as most movie stars get by the time they break through. Acting ability is only one piece of that puzzle\u2014you also need a knack for getting yourself in front of people with power, a shrewdness for personal branding, an insane amount of optimism, a ridiculous amount of hustle and persistence, etc. If you get good enough at that whole game\u2014every component of it\u2014your chances of becoming an A-list movie star are actually pretty high. That\u2019s what hitting the star means.\nBut conventional wisdom doesn\u2019t get how non-traditional careers work\u2014it only thinks in terms of a narrow aspect of success: talent and hard work. When career paths have game boards with much more going on, conventional wisdom just throws its hands up and calls it \u201cluck.\u201d To conventional wisdom, becoming a movie star requires some talent, but mostly, hitting a rare scratch ticket jackpot.\nSo how do you figure out your chances of getting to any particular star? It\u2019s all about a simple formula:\nDistance = Speed x Time.\nIn our case, the more apt wording might be:\nProgress = Pace x Persistence.\nYour outlook on any career quest depends on A) the pace at which you\u2019ll be able to improve at playing that career\u2019s \u201cgame\u201d and B) the amount of time you\u2019re willing to persist in chasing that star. Let\u2019s talk about both of these:\nPace\nWhat makes someone slower or faster at improving at a career game? I\u2019d say it comes down to three factors:\nYour level of chefness. As we discussed earlier, chefs look at the world with fresh eyes and build conclusions based on what they observe and what they\u2019ve experienced. Cooks arrive at conclusions by following someone else\u2019s recipe\u2014in the case of careers, the recipe is usually conventional wisdom. Careers are complex games that almost everyone starts off bad at\u2014then the chefs improve rapidly through a continual loop\u2026\n\n\u2026while cooks improve at a snail\u2019s pace, because their strategy is just following a recipe which itself barely changes. What\u2019s more, in a world where career games are constantly evolving and morphing, the chef\u2019s tactics can evolve in real time and keep up. Meanwhile, the cook\u2019s recipe just grows more and more outdated\u2014a problem they remain oblivious to. This is why I\u2019m pretty convinced that at least for less traditional careers, your level of chefness is the single most important factor in determining your pace of improvement.\nYour work ethic. This one is obvious. Someone who works on their career 60 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, is going to move down the path almost four times faster than someone who works 20 hours a week, 40 weeks a year. Someone who chooses a balanced lifestyle will move slower than a single-minded workaholic. Someone with a propensity towards laziness or procrastination is going to lose a lot of ground to someone who\u2019s good at putting in consistent work days. Someone who frequently breaks from work to daydream or pick up their phone is going to get less done in each work hour than someone who practices deep focus.\nYour natural abilities. Talent does matter. Smarter, more talented people will improve at a game at a faster rate than less naturally gifted people. But intelligence and talent are only two types of natural ability that come into play here. Cleverness and savvy matter too, and those qualities don\u2019t always correlate with raw intelligence. Depending on the type of career, social skills can be critically important as well. In many careers, likable (or subtly manipulative) people have a big advantage over less likable people\u2014and those who enjoy socializing will put in more people hours over time, and build deeper relationships, than antisocial types.\nOther things, like existing connections, existing resources, and existing skills matter, of course, but they\u2019re not components of pace\u2014they\u2019re part of the location of point A.\nPersistence\nWhen I say persistence, I\u2019m referring to long-term persistence (as opposed to day-to-day work ethic). Persistence is simpler than pace. The more years you\u2019re willing to commit to chasing a star, the farther along the road towards the star you\u2019ll get. A car going 30 mph that quits driving after 15 minutes gets a lot less far than a car that drives 10 mph for two hours.\nAnd this is why persistence is so important. Someone who has decided they\u2019re only willing to give a dream career a shot for three years before they\u2019ll go for their fallback plan has essentially disqualified themselves from a chance at their dreams. It doesn\u2019t matter how awesome you are\u2014if you\u2019ll give up after two or three years of not breaking through, you\u2019re unlikely to succeed. A few years is just not enough time to traverse the typically long distances it takes to get to the raddest success stars, no matter how impressive your pace.\nYour Real Strengths and Weaknesses\nWith our pace-times-persistence equation in mind, let\u2019s revisit the concept of strengths and weaknesses. It\u2019s not that \u201cstrengths and weaknesses\u201d is a bad concept\u2014it\u2019s that we think about it all wrong. When we list our strengths, we tend to list our areas of existing skill more than anything else. Instead, strengths should be all about pace and persistence qualities. Originality or lack thereof should be a critical component of the discussion, making qualities like agility and humility (trademark chef traits) notable strengths, and qualities like stubbornness8 or intellectual laziness (classic cook traits) important weaknesses. The subtleties of work ethic, like a knack for deep focus or a propensity to procrastinate, should also be a major part of the discussion, as should natural abilities beyond talent, like savvy and likability. Qualities related to persistence, like resilience and determination and patience, should be thought of as promising strengths, while a social tentacle clamoring to appear successful as quickly as possible should be viewed as a bright red flag.\nMost importantly, these items shouldn\u2019t be discussed as a snapshot of where they are now, but rather in terms of your potential for improvement in each of them. If you handed 25-year-old Michael Jordan a basketball for the first time, he\u2019d suck. But calling basketball a \u201cweakness\u201d of his would be getting it very wrong. Instead, you\u2019d want to watch him practice over the next six weeks and evaluate the slope of his improvement. This lesson applies to specific skills\u2014but most general pace and persistence qualities can also be worked on and improved if you focus on them.\nFilling in the Reality Box\nYour true Reality Box would literally include all career paths for which you think a highly improved version of yourself could, with an entire lifetime of effort, reach the minimum star you\u2019d be comfortable defining as success. This would be an impossibly big list, only ruling out paths that are clearly far too long for you to traverse at your maximum possible pace on the path (like me chasing a career as an Olympic figure skater). But it\u2019s still useful to pause for a minute and reflect on the vast extent of your full Reality Box\u2014just acknowledging how many options are truly open to you can put you in the right mindset.9\nSo to be a bit more efficient, let\u2019s worry about the parts of the Reality Box that might actually end up in your Option Pool (the middle of the Venn diagram where the Want and Reality Boxes overlap). To complete our Reality Box audit with that caveat, we need to evaluate:\n1) The general landscape. Take our best crack at evaluating the world\u2019s current career landscape\u2014the full range of options available (or create-able).\n2) Specific game boards. For any careers that sound remotely interesting, ponder what the deal might be with that career\u2019s current game board\u2014the parties involved, the way success seems to be happening for others recently, the most up-to-date rules of the game, the latest new loopholes that are being exploited, etc.\n3) Starting point. For those paths, evaluate your starting point, based on your current skills, resources, and connections relevant to that field.\n4) Success point. Think about end points and where on each line your star should be placed. Ask yourself what\u2019s the minimum level of success you\u2019d need to achieve in order to feel happy about having chosen that career path.\n5) Your pace. Make an initial estimate for what your pace of improvement might be on these various game boards, based on your current pace-related strengths and how much you think you can improve at each of them (in other words, how much your speed might be able to accelerate).\n6) Your level of persistence. Evaluate the amount of time you think you\u2019ll be willing to put into each of these respective paths.\nNow it\u2019s just math. You take your game board and make it a line, you plot starting points and success stars that together generate the various distances in front of you, and for each, you multiply your pace by your level of persistence. If it seems like the product of your pace and persistence for a given career path might be able to measure up to the path\u2019s total length, that career lands in your Reality Box. Of course, it\u2019s impossible to get exact values for any of the above factors, but it\u2019s good to at least know the equation you\u2019re working with.\nA from-first-principles Reality Box audit may bring some overly optimistic people down to Earth, but I suspect that for most, an audit will leave them feeling like they have a lot more options than they realized, empowering them to set their sights on a bolder direction.\nA good Reality Box reflection warrants yet another Want Box reflection. Reframing a bunch of career paths in your mind will affect your level of yearning for some of them. One career may seem less appealing after reminding yourself that it will entail thousands of hours of networking or multiple decades of pre-success struggle. Another may seem less daunting after changing your mind about how much luck is actually involved. There will be other career paths you hadn\u2019t considered wanting because you hadn\u2019t considered them as real options, but some deep reflection has opened your mind to them.\nThis brings us to the end of our long, two-part deep dive. After a fairly exhausting box-auditing process, we can return to our Venn10 diagram.\n\nAssuming some things have changed, you have a new Option Pool to look at\u2014a new list of options on the table that seem both desirable to your high-priority rankings and possible to achieve. We\u2019re ready now to return to where we were before we started our analysis: the present moment. With these options in front of us, we\u2019re ready to lift our heads up out of analysis and look forward into the future.\nConnecting the Dots into the Future\nIt\u2019s time to bring back your Career Plans map that I made you put down at the beginning of the post\u2014the one with the arrow or the question mark. If there had been a clear arrow on your map before your audit, check out your new Option Pool. Given everything you\u2019ve reflected upon, does your current career plan still qualify to be there? If so, congrats\u2014you\u2019re ahead of most of us.\nIf not, well that\u2019s shitty news, but it\u2019s also good news. Remember, going from a false arrow to a question mark is always major progress in life.\n\nAnd actually, a new question mark implies having made the key cliff jump on two roller coasters: getting to know yourself and getting to know the world. Major step in the right direction. Cross out the arrow and join the question mark crowd.\nNow the question mark crowd has a tough choice. You gotta pick one of the arrows in the Option Pool.\nIt\u2019s a tough choice\u2014but it should be way less tough than it is. Here\u2019s why:\nCareers used to be kind of like a 40-year tunnel. You picked your tunnel, and once you were in, that was that. You worked in that profession for 40 years or so before the tunnel spit you out on the other side into your retirement.\n\nThe truth is, careers have probably never really functioned like 40-year-tunnels, they just seemed that way. At best, traditional careers of the past played out kind of like tunnels.\nToday\u2019s careers\u2014especially the less traditional ones\u2014are really really not like tunnels. But crusty old conventional wisdom has a lot of us still viewing things that way, which makes the already hard job of making big career path choices much harder.\nWhen you think of your career as a tunnel, it causes an identity crisis in anyone who doesn\u2019t feel sure of who exactly they are and who they\u2019ll want to be decades from now\u2014which is most sane people. It enhances the delusion that what we do for work is a synonym for who we are, making a question mark on your map seem like an existential disaster.\nWhen you think of your career as a tunnel, the stakes to make the right choice seem so high that it explodes the feeling of tyranny of choice. For perfectionist types especially, this can be utterly paralyzing.\nWhen you think of your career as a tunnel, you lose the courage to make a career switch, even when your soul is begging for it. It makes switching careers feel incredibly risky and embarrassing, and it suggests that someone who does so is a failure. It also makes all kinds of multi-faceted, vibrant, mid-career people feel like they\u2019re too old to make a bold switch or start a whole new path afresh.\nBut conventional wisdom still tells many of us that careers are tunnels. As the icing on its shit cake\u2014on top of helping us yearn for things we don\u2019t actually want, deny yearnings that we feel deep down, fear things that aren\u2019t dangerous, and believe things about the world and our potential that aren\u2019t accurate\u2014conventional wisdom tells us that careers are a tunnel to help us daunt the shit out of ourselves unnecessarily.\nToday\u2019s career landscape isn\u2019t a lineup of tunnels, it\u2019s a massive, impossibly complex, rapidly changing science laboratory. Today\u2019s people aren\u2019t synonymous with what they do\u2014they\u2019re impossibly complex, rapidly changing scientists. And today\u2019s career isn\u2019t a tunnel, or a box, or an identity label\u2014it\u2019s a long series of science experiments.\nSteve Jobs compared life to connecting the dots, pointing out that while it\u2019s easy to look at your past and see how the dots connected to lead you to where you are, it\u2019s basically impossible in life to connect the dots forwards.\nIf you look at the biographies of your heroes, you\u2019ll see that their paths look a lot more like a long series of connected dots than a straight and predictable tunnel. If you look at yourself and your friends, you\u2019ll probably see the same trend\u2014according to data, the median time a young person stays in a given job is only 3 years (older people spend a longer time on each dot, but not that much longer\u201410.4 years on average).\nSo seeing your career as a series of dots isn\u2019t a mental trick to help you make decisions\u2014it\u2019s an accurate depiction of what\u2019s actually happening. And seeing your career as a tunnel isn\u2019t just unproductive\u2014it\u2019s delusional.\nLikewise, you\u2019re limited to focusing mainly on the next dot on your path\u2014because it\u2019s the only dot you can figure out. You don\u2019t have to worry about dot #4 because you can\u2019t anyway\u2014you\u2019re literally not qualified to do so.\nBy the time dot #4 rolls around, you will have learned stuff about yourself you don\u2019t know now. You\u2019ll also have changed from who you are now, and your Yearning Octopus will reflect those changes. You\u2019ll know a lot more than you currently do about the career landscape and the specific game boards you\u2019re interested in, and you\u2019ll have become a much better game player. And of course, that landscape\u2014and those game boards\u2014will have themselves evolved.\nThe fantastic website 80,000 Hours (which exists to help young, talented people work through their career choices) has compiled a lot of data to back this up: data on the fact that you\u2019ll change, that the world will change, and that you\u2019ll only learn with time what you\u2019re actually good at. Popular psychologist Dan Gilbert also eloquently describes just how bad we are at predicting what will make us happy in the future.\nPretending you can figure out what dot #2 or #4 or #8 should be now is laughable. Future dots are the worry of a future, wiser you living in a future world. So let\u2019s focus on dot #1.\nIf we\u2019re thinking of ourselves as scientists and of society as a science lab, we should think of your current freshly revised Want-Reality Venn Diagram as nothing more than an early, rough hypothesis. Dot #1 is your chance to test it out.\nHypothesis testing is intuitive in the dating world. If a friend were toiling over what kind of person she wants to marry but never went out with anyone, you\u2019d tell her, \u201cYou can\u2019t figure this out on your couch\u2014you\u2019ve gotta start going on dates, and that\u2019ll teach you what you want in a partner.\u201d If that friend then went on a solid first date and returned home to toil for hours about whether or not this new person was The One, you\u2019d again have to correct her. You\u2019d say, \u201cThere\u2019s no way you can know that from just one date! You have to get some experience dating this person to learn what you need to learn to make that decision.\u201d\nWe can all agree that this hypothetical friend is pretty nuts and is lacking a fundamental understanding of how you find a happy relationship. So let\u2019s not be like her when it comes to picking our career. Dot #1 is a chill situation\u2014it\u2019s just a first date.\nThis is awesome news\u2014because it makes it a lot less scary to draw an arrow on your map if it\u2019s only an arrow to dot #1 of your future. The real cause of tyranny of choice is accurately seeing the sheer number of options you have in today\u2019s world while delusionally seeing those careers as the 40-year tunnels of yesterday\u2019s world. That\u2019s a lethal combo. Reframing your next major career decision as a far lower-stakes choice makes the number of options exciting, not stressful.\nAnd that\u2019s all great in theory. But now comes the hard part.\nMaking Your Move\nYou\u2019ve reflected and reflected and reflected and weighed and measured and predicted and considered. You\u2019ve chosen a dot and drawn an arrow. And now you have to actually make the move.\nWe\u2019re super bad at this. We\u2019re frightened people. We don\u2019t like icky things and making a bold, real-life step is icky. If there\u2019s any ounce of procrastination susceptibility in us, here\u2019s where it\u2019ll show itself.\nThe Yearning Octopus can help. As we discussed earlier, your behavior at any given point simply displays the configuration of your octopus. If you\u2019ve decided on a life step and you can\u2019t quite take it, it\u2019s because the parts of you that don\u2019t want to make a move are ranked higher in your subconscious than the parts of you that do. Your conscious mind may have tried to assign lower shelf ratings to the parts of your octopus that lean towards inertia, but your yearnings have rebelled. You\u2019re a CEO not in control of their staff.\nTo fix this problem, think like a kindergarten teacher. In your class, a faction of the 5-year-olds is rebelling against your wishes. What do you do?\nGo talk to the 5-year-olds that are causing the trouble. They\u2019re unpleasant, defiant simpletons, but they can still be reasoned with. Talk to them about why you\u2019ve ranked them lower than others in the octopus hierarchy. Describe to them the insights you gained from your Reality Box reflection. Remind them about how connecting the dots works and about the chillness of dot #1. You\u2019re the teacher\u2014figure it out.\nThe older I get, the clearer it becomes that our internal battle as the kindergarten teachers of our mind is like 97% of life\u2019s struggle. The world is easy\u2014you\u2019re difficult. If you find yourself continually not executing your plans in life and your promises to yourself, you\u2019ve uncovered your new #1 priority\u2014becoming a better kindergarten teacher. Until you do, your life will be run by a bunch of primitive, short-sighted 5-year-olds, and your whole shit will suck. Trust me, I know.\nIf your inner analysis does call for a career leap to a new dot, I hope that at some point, you\u2019re able to make the jump.\nAfter the Move\nJumping to a new dot is a liberating feeling, usually side by side with some substantial internal havoc.\nFirst of all, for a while at least, you\u2019ll probably suck at what you\u2019re doing on your new dot. While your wise self will know that\u2019s exactly how it should be, your less wise selves will go into full existential meltdown mode. All of the fears you so thoughtfully deprioritized in your octopus ranking will think someone is murdering them and they\u2019ll start trying to call 911. The yearnings you did prioritize won\u2019t be feeling much gratification yet, and they\u2019ll wonder if they were wrong all along about what they thought they wanted. The yearnings you didn\u2019t prioritize will get out the guitar and start singing love songs for the greener-seeming grass you deprived them of. It won\u2019t be much fun.\nEven if things do go well, you\u2019ll be quickly reminded of the fact that the Yearning Octopus is a generally unhappy creature. Core pieces of the octopus will feel neglected or even assaulted, and every day that goes by, you\u2019ll be bearing the opportunity cost of the paths you were considering but chose not to walk down\u2014the versions of you in parallel universes where you made other choices. You\u2019ll think about their hypothetical advancement in the world and worry about what you may have passed up.\n\nAs you get wiser, you\u2019ll learn to view a largely unhappy octopus with acceptance. You\u2019ll let it whine and get good at tuning it out, knowing that it\u2019s whining in the exact way you planned for it to be.\nThe whining octopus is a reminder of why pure, elated happiness is never a reasonable goal. The times you feel pure happiness are temporary, drug-induced delusions\u2014like the honeymoon phase of a new relationship or new job or the high following a long-awaited success. Those moments are the perfect golf shots of a mediocre golfer\u2019s outing\u2014they\u2019re awesome, and you should enjoy the shit out of them\u2014but they\u2019re not the new normal, and they never will be.\nA better goal is contentment: the satisfying feeling that you\u2019re currently taking the best crack you can at a good life path; that what you\u2019re working on might prove to be a piece of an eventual puzzle you can feel really proud of. Chasing happiness is an amateur move. Feeling contentment in those times when your choices and your circumstances have combined to pull it off, and knowing you have all that you could ever ask for, is for the wise.\nPeople talk about being present in the moment, but there\u2019s also the broader concept of macro-presence: feeling broadly present in your own life. If you\u2019re on a career dot that, when you\u2019re being really honest with yourself, feels right, you get to stop thinking and stop planning for a while and just dig in. You\u2019ll come back to the big picture later\u2014for now, you can put the macro picture aside, put your head down, and dedicate all of your energy to the present. For a while, you can just live.\nThese moments don\u2019t always last that long, so sink your teeth in. Put everything you\u2019ve got into the dot you\u2019ve chosen. As far as you know, you might be Michael Jordan holding his first basketball, so start playing.\nThe Next Dot?\nAt some point, your good feelings about the macro picture may sour. And when they do, you\u2019ll have to get back into analysis mode and figure out what, in particular, is causing the restlessness.\nSometimes, the macro mission won\u2019t be the problem. It\u2019ll be that the chef in you has decided that the mission itself calls for a strategic dot jump. In these cases, jumping dots isn\u2019t a release of persistence but the stuff of persistence. This is the mission-enhancing type of dot jump.\nOther times, you\u2019ll feel a darker kind of restlessness\u2014the suspicion that you may need to change up the macro mission. When this happens, you\u2019ll have to figure out if that feeling is emerging from the wise parts of you or simply from your restless, deprioritized yearnings. A mission-changing dot jump may be in order, but depending on which parts of you are asking for it, it may also be the wrong move.\nIn these moments, it\u2019s important to consider where you tend to be on this spectrum:\n\nThe people on the left side of this spectrum are jump-shy. The cement-footed. Their pitfall is staying way too long in the wrong things. The people on the right are jump-happy\u2014the wing-footed\u2014and they have the opposite pitfall: they\u2019re quick quitters.11 (You should be especially wary of cement feet\u2014psychologists believe that people at the end of their lives are most likely to regret living by inertia: a commonly voiced regret is \u201cI wish I had quit earlier,\u201d and the most common advice of the elderly is, \u201cDon\u2019t stay in a job you dislike.\u201c)\nThis is why these internal frameworks are important. They give you the ability to analyze the source of your impulses. In our example, the question is whether your impulse to jump missions is the result of genuine evolution or quick-quitter bias. So think about your diagram. Is your restlessness just the expected incessant whining of an octopus still correctly configured? The weariness from a long trudge on what\u2019s still the right path for you? Or have you learned new information about yourself or the world during the trudge that has corrected some off-base initial assumptions? Or maybe something is fundamentally evolving\u2014some blue or yellow loop activity:\n\nIf you feel that things have genuinely changed, you may decide to zoom out even further and think about the big red loop, which deals with fundamentally changing your mission:\n\nIf a career is like connecting the dots, we should probably rank \u201cgetting wise about dot-jumping\u201d pretty high on our to-do list. The best place to start is by looking at your own past. Studying your own past decisions, with the flashlight of hindsight and accumulated wisdom, is like an athlete studying game tape.\nLooking at my own past, I can see a lot of dot jumps (or, while I was still in school, career plan adjustments), and some of them look pretty unwise in retrospect. But the clearer a picture I can see of my past bad decisions and the thought patterns and behavioral habits that built them, the less likely I\u2019ll be to repeat them in the future.\nRemembering that you\u2019re kind of dumb is also a critical humbling exercise. The insecurity of humility doesn\u2019t feel very good, and the burden of having to continually invent your own life map is never easy\u2014but insecurity and difficulty are the feelings of driving your own ship. It\u2019s when we feel too good that we run the risk of becoming overconfident, intellectually complacent, and set in our ways. It\u2019s exactly when we think we have life all figured out that we end up losing our way.\n___________\nOver the course of your life, your good and bad decisions will collaborate to forge your unique life path. Often on this blog, I\u2019ve written about how irrational our fears can be and how badly they can hold us back. But we should probably embrace the fear of end-of-life regret.\nI\u2019ve thankfully never been on anything that felt like a deathbed, but it seems like there\u2019s something about the end of life that lets people see things with clear eyes. It seems like facing death makes all of those voices in your head who aren\u2019t actually you melt away, leaving your little authentic self standing there all alone, in reflection. I think end-of-life regrets may simply be your authentic self thinking about the parts of your life you never got to live\u2014the parts of you that someone else kicked down into your subconscious.\nMy own psyche seems to back this up\u2014looking back on my path so far, the mistakes that bother me most are the ones that happened because someone else took the wheel of my head and overruled the quiet, insecure voice of my authentic self\u2014the mistakes that I knew at the time, deep down, were wrong. My goal for the future isn\u2019t to avoid mistakes, it\u2019s for the mistakes I do make to be my own.\nThat\u2019s why I went through such an excruciatingly rigorous analysis in this post. I think this is one of those few topics in life that\u2019s worth it. Other voices will never stop fiercely trying to live your life for you\u2014you owe it to that little insecure character in the very center of your consciousness to get this right.\n_______\n\nIf you like Wait But Why, sign up for our email list and we\u2019ll send you new posts when they come out.\nTo support Wait But Why, visit our Patreon page.\nIf you want to download this post for printing and offline sharing, you can buy it here.\n___________\nFor help analyzing your situation:\nSome paper to write on: Your octopus.

Seth has a lot of wisdom in his head, and he doles it out in little bite-sized nuggets each morning on his blog (which I receive by email). A lot of Seth\u2019s advice applies to career choices. Here\u2019s an example (which I adapted into one of the cartoons in this post).\nEric Barker\u2019s blog is full of actual data that can help with career choices, like this post on what makes a career fulfilling or this one on the importance of mentors.\n___________\nMore Wait But Why human deep dives:\nThe Marriage Decision: Everything Forever or Nothing Ever Again\nWhy Procrastinators Procrastinate\nAnd a post about getting wiser\nAnd a few less self-reflect-y Wait But Why posts on:\nAwkward social interactions\nThe history of everything\nColonizing Mars\nAnd other higher education.\u21a9Also hoodies are cozy and Allbirds are like wearing socks all the time and jeans are magical pants you never have to actually wash unless you spill something colorful on them.\u21a9Fun meals and exercise fall into this category.\u21a9I personally hope my retirement is just as rich and vibrant as a career path, which means I\u2019ll need to continue to reflect on my path in Retirement Orchard.\u21a9You know he\u2019s actually a Yearning Pentapus, I know he\u2019s actually a Yearning Pentapus, and he knows he\u2019s actually a Yearning Pentapus\u2014but let\u2019s just leave it alone.\u21a9There are printouts at the bottom of the post if you\u2019d like to work through your analysis on paper.\u21a9Did you know that 9 out of 10 restaurants fail?!\u21a9Stubbornness is a cook quality because it means being a cook to your previous self\u2014i.e. treating your previous self\u2019s opinions and methods and habits as your permanent recipe.\u21a9Or totally paralyze you and ruin your happiness!\u21a9John Venn really pulled something off here. A Venn diagram is the most obvious possible kind of diagram, and somehow, John Venn convinced everyone he invented it. And this is despite openly saying he didn\u2019t invent it. Venn explains: \u201cI began at once somewhat more steady work on the subjects and books which I should have to lecture on. I now first hit upon the diagrammatical device of representing propositions by inclusive and exclusive circles. Of course the device was not new then, but it was so obviously representative of the way in which any one, who approached the subject from the mathematical side, would attempt to visualize propositions, that it was forced upon me almost at once.\u201d\u21a9This spectrum, of course, is also highly relevant in relationships.\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAbout Tim Urban\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tView all posts by Tim Urban \u2192 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious

You can buy it here.And here\u2019s a G-rated version of the post, appropriate for all ages.\n_______________________\nLast month, I got a phone call.\n\nOkay maybe that\u2019s not exactly how it happened, and maybe those weren\u2019t his exact words. But after learning about the new company Elon Musk was starting, I\u2019ve come to realize that that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s trying to do.\nWhen I wrote about Tesla and SpaceX, I learned that you can only fully wrap your head around certain companies by zooming both way, way in and way, way out. In, on the technical challenges facing the engineers, out on the existential challenges facing our species. In on a snapshot of the world right now, out on the big story of how we got to this moment and what our far future could look like.\nNot only is Elon\u2019s new venture\u2014Neuralink\u2014the same type of deal, but six weeks after first learning about the company, I\u2019m convinced that it somehow manages to eclipse Tesla and SpaceX in both the boldness of its engineering undertaking and the grandeur of its mission. The other two companies aim to redefine what future humans will do\u2014Neuralink wants to redefine what future humans will be.\nThe mind-bending bigness of Neuralink\u2019s mission, combined with the labyrinth of impossible complexity that is the human brain, made this the hardest set of concepts yet to fully wrap my head around\u2014but it also made it the most exhilarating when, with enough time spent zoomed on both ends, it all finally clicked. I feel like I took a time machine to the future, and I\u2019m here to tell you that it\u2019s even weirder than we expect.\nBut before I can bring you in the time machine to show you what I found, we need to get in our zoom machine\u2014because as I learned the hard way, Elon\u2019s wizard hat plans cannot be properly understood until your head\u2019s in the right place.\nSo wipe your brain clean of what it thinks it knows about itself and its future, put on soft clothes, and let\u2019s jump into the vortex.\n___________\nContents\nPart 1: The Human Colossus \nPart 2: The Brain \nPart 3: Brain-Machine Interfaces \nPart 4: Neuralink\u2019s Challenge \nPart 5: The Wizard Era\nPart 6: The Great Merger \n\n\nPart 1: The Human Colossus\n600 million years ago, no one really did anything, ever.\n \nThe problem is that no one had any nerves. Without nerves, you can\u2019t move, or think, or process information of any kind. So you just had to kind of exist and wait there until you died.\nBut then came the jellyfish.\n\nThe jellyfish was the first animal to figure out that nerves were an obvious thing to make sure you had, and it had the world\u2019s first nervous system\u2014a nerve net.\n\n  \nThe jellyfish\u2019s nerve net allowed it to collect important information from the world around it\u2014like where there were objects, predators, or food\u2014and pass that information along, through a big game of telephone, to all parts of its body. Being able to receive and process information meant that the jellyfish could actually react to changes in its environment in order to increase the odds of life going well, rather than just floating aimlessly and hoping for the best.\nA little later, a new animal came around who had an even cooler idea.\n\nThe flatworm figured out that you could get a lot more done if there was someone in the nervous system who was in charge of everything\u2014a nervous system boss. The boss lived in the flatworm\u2019s head and had a rule that all nerves in the body had to report any new information directly to him. So instead of arranging themselves in a net shape, the flatworm\u2019s nervous system all revolved around a central highway of messenger nerves that would pass messages back and forth between the boss and everyone else:\n \nThe flatworm\u2019s boss-highway system was the world\u2019s first central nervous system, and the boss in the flatworm\u2019s head was the world\u2019s first brain.\nThe idea of a nervous system boss quickly caught on with others, and soon, there were thousands of species on Earth with brains.\nAs time passed and Earth\u2019s animals started inventing intricate new body systems, the bosses got busier.\n\n\n\nA little while later came the arrival of mammals. For the Millennials of the Animal Kingdom, life was complicated. Yes, their hearts needed to beat and their lungs needed to breathe, but mammals were about a lot more than survival functions\u2014they were in touch with complex feelings like love, anger, and fear.\nFor the reptilian brain, which had only had to deal with reptiles and other simpler creatures so far, mammals were just\u2026a lot. So a second boss developed in mammals to pair up with the reptilian brain and take care of all of these new needs\u2014the world\u2019s first limbic system.\n\n\nOver the next 100 million years, the lives of mammals grew more and more complex, and one day, the two bosses noticed a new resident in the cockpit with them.\n \nWhat appeared to be a random infant was actually the early version of the neocortex, and though he didn\u2019t say much at first, as evolution gave rise to primates and then great apes and then early hominids, this new boss grew from a baby into a child and eventually into a teenager with his own idea of how things should be run.\n  \nThe new boss\u2019s ideas turned out to be really helpful, and he became the hominid\u2019s go-to boss for things like tool-making, hunting strategy, and cooperation with other hominids.\nOver the next few million years, the new boss grew older and wiser, and his ideas kept getting better. He figured out how to not be naked. He figured out how to control fire. He learned how to make a spear.\n\nBut his coolest trick was thinking. He turned each human\u2019s head into a little world of its own, making humans the first animal that could think complex thoughts, reason through decisions, and make long-term plans.\nAnd then, maybe about 100,000 years ago, he came up with a breakthrough.\n                   \nThe human brain had advanced to the point where it could understand that even though the sound \u201crock\u201d was not itself a rock, it could be used as a symbol of a rock\u2014it was a sound that referred to a rock. The early human had invented language.\nSoon there were words for all kinds of things, and by 50,000 BC, humans were speaking in full, complex language with each other.\nThe neocortex had turned humans into magicians. Not only had he made the human head a wondrous internal ocean of complex thoughts, his latest breakthrough had found a way to translate those thoughts into a symbolic set of sounds and send them vibrating through the air into the heads of other humans, who could then decode the sounds and absorb the embedded idea into their own internal thought oceans. The human neocortex had been thinking about things for a long time\u2014and he finally had someone to talk about it all with.\nA neocortex party ensued. Neocortexes\u2014fine\u2014neocortices shared everything with each other\u2014stories from their past, funny jokes they had thought of, opinions they had formed, plans for the future.\nBut most useful was sharing what they had learned. If one human learned through trial and error that a certain type of berry led to 48 hours of your life being run by diarrhea, they could use language to share the hard-earned lesson with the rest of their tribe, like photocopying the lesson and handing it to everyone else. Tribe members would then use language to pass along that lesson to their children, and their children would pass it to their own children. Rather than the same mistake being made again and again by many different people, one person\u2019s \u201cstay away from that berry\u201d wisdom could travel through space and time to protect everyone else from having their bad experience.\nThe same thing would happen when one human figured out a new clever trick. One unusually-intelligent hunter particularly attuned to both star constellations and the annual migration patterns of wildebeest1 herds could share a system he devised that used the night sky to determine exactly how many days remained until the herd would return. Even though very few hunters would have been able to come up with that system on their own, through word-of-mouth, all future hunters in the tribe would now benefit from the ingenuity of one ancestor, with that one hunter\u2019s crowning discovery serving as every future hunter\u2019s starting point of knowledge.\nAnd let\u2019s say this knowledge advancement makes the hunting season more efficient, which gives tribe members more time to work on their weapons\u2014which allows one extra-clever hunter a few generations later to discover a method for making lighter, denser spears that can be thrown more accurately. And just like that, every present and future hunter in the tribe hunts with a more effective spear.\nLanguage allows the best epiphanies of the very smartest people, through the generations, to accumulate into a little collective tower of tribal knowledge\u2014a \u201cgreatest hits\u201d of their ancestors\u2019 best \u201caha!\u201d moments. Every new generation has this knowledge tower installed in their heads as their starting point in life, leading them to new, even better discoveries that build on what their ancestors learned, as the tribe\u2019s knowledge continues to grow bigger and wiser. Language is the difference between this:\n\nAnd this:\n\nThe major trajectory upgrade happens for two reasons. Each generation can learn a lot more new things when they can talk to each other, compare notes, and combine their individual learnings (that\u2019s why the blue bars are so much higher in the second graph). And each generation can successfully pass a higher percentage of their learnings on to the next generation, so knowledge sticks better through time.\nKnowledge, when shared, becomes like a grand, collective, inter-generational collaboration. Hundreds of generations later, what started as a pro tip about a certain berry to avoid has become an intricate system of planting long rows of the stomach-friendly berry bushes and harvesting them annually. The initial stroke of genius about wildebeest migrations has turned into a system of goat domestication. The spear innovation, through hundreds of incremental tweaks over tens of thousands of years, has become the bow and arrow.\nLanguage gives a group of humans a collective intelligence far greater than individual human intelligence and allows each human to benefit from the collective intelligence as if he came up with it all himself. We think of the bow and arrow as a primitive technology, but raise Einstein in the woods with no existing knowledge and tell him to come up with the best hunting device he can, and he won\u2019t be nearly intelligent or skilled or knowledgeable enough to invent the bow and arrow. Only a collective human effort can pull that off.\nBeing able to speak to each other also allowed humans to form complex social structures which, along with advanced technologies like farming and animal domestication, led tribes over time to begin to settle into permanent locations and merge into organized super-tribes. When this happened, each tribe\u2019s tower of accumulated knowledge could be shared with the larger super-tribe, forming a super-tower. Mass cooperation raised the quality of life for everyone, and by 10,000 BC, the first cities had formed.\nAccording to Wikipedia, there\u2019s something called Metcalfe\u2019s law, which states that \u201cthe value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system.\u201d And they include this little chart of old telephones:1\n\nBut the same idea applies to people. Two people can have one conversation. Three people have four unique conversation groups (three different two-person conversations and a fourth conversation between all three as a group). Five people have 26. Twenty people have 1,048,555.\nSo not only did the members of a city benefit from a huge knowledge tower as a foundation, but Metcalfe\u2019s law means that the number of conversation possibilities now skyrocketed to an unprecedented amount of variety. More conversations meant more ideas bumping up against each other, which led to many more discoveries clicking together, and the pace of innovation soared.\nHumans soon mastered agriculture, which freed many people up to think about all kinds of other ideas, and it wasn\u2019t long before they stumbled upon a new, giant breakthrough: writing.\nHistorians think humans first started writing things down about 5 \u2013 6,000 years ago. Up until that point, the collective knowledge tower was stored only in a network of people\u2019s memories and accessed only through livestream word-of-mouth communication. This system worked in small tribes, but with a vastly larger body of knowledge shared among a vastly larger group of people, memories alone would have had a hard time supporting it all, and most of it would have ended up lost.\nIf language let humans send a thought from one brain to another, writing let them stick a thought onto a physical object, like a stone, where it could live forever. When people began writing on thin sheets of parchment or paper, huge fields of knowledge that would take weeks to be conveyed by word of mouth could be compressed into a book or a scroll you could hold in your hand. The human collective knowledge tower now lived in physical form, neatly organized on the shelves of city libraries and universities.\nThese shelves became humanity\u2019s grand instruction manual on everything. They guided humanity toward new inventions and discoveries, and those would in turn become new books on the shelves, as the grand instruction manual built upon itself. The manual taught us the intricacies of trade and currency, of shipbuilding and architecture, of medicine and astronomy. Each generation began life with a higher floor of knowledge and technology than the last, and progress continued to accelerate.\nBut painstakingly handwritten books were treated like treasures,2 and likely only accessible to the extreme elite (in the mid 15th century, there were only 30,000 books in all of Europe). And then came another breakthrough: the printing press.\nIn the 15th century, the beardy Johannes Gutenberg came up with a way to create multiple identical copies of the same book, much more quickly and cheaply than ever before. (Or, more accurately, when Gutenberg was born, humanity had already figured out the first 95% of how to invent the printing press, and Gutenberg, with that knowledge as his starting point, invented the last 5%.) (Oh, also, Gutenberg didn\u2019t invent the printing press, the Chinese did a bunch of centuries earlier. Pretty reliable rule is that everything you think was invented somewhere other than China was probably actually invented in China.) Here\u2019s how it worked:\n\nIt Turns Out Gutenberg Isn\u2019t Actually Impressive Blue Box\nTo prepare to write this blue box, I found this video explaining how Gutenberg\u2019s press worked and was surprised to find myself unimpressed. I always assumed Gutenberg had made some genius machine, but it turns out he just created a bunch of stamps of letters and punctuation and manually arranged them as the page of a book and then put ink on them and pressed a piece of paper onto the letters, and that was one book page. While he had the letters all set up for that page, he\u2019d make a bunch of copies. Then he\u2019d spend forever manually rearranging the stamps (this is the \u201cmovable type\u201d part) into the next page, and then do a bunch of copies of that. His first project was 180 copies of the Bible,3 which took him and his employees two years.\nThat\u2018s Gutenberg\u2019s thing? A bunch of stamps? I feel like I could have come up with that pretty easily. Not really clear why it took humanity 5,000 years to go from figuring out how to write to creating a bunch of manual stamps. I guess it\u2019s not that I\u2019m unimpressed with Gutenberg\u2014I\u2019m neutral on Gutenberg, he\u2019s fine\u2014it\u2019s that I\u2019m unimpressed with everyone else.\n\nAnyway, despite how disappointing Gutenberg\u2019s press turned out to be, it was a huge leap forward for humanity\u2019s ability to spread information. Over the coming centuries, printing technology rapidly improved, bringing the number of pages a machine could print in an hour from about 25 in Gutenberg\u2019s time4 up 100-fold to 2,400 by the early 19th century.2\nMass-produced books allowed information to spread like wildfire, and with books being made increasingly affordable, no longer was education an elite privilege\u2014millions now had access to books, and literacy rates shot upwards. One person\u2019s thoughts could now reach millions of people. The era of mass communication had begun.\nThe avalanche of books allowed knowledge to transcend borders, as the world\u2019s regional knowledge towers finally merged into one species-wide knowledge tower that stretched into the stratosphere.\nThe better we could communicate on a mass scale, the more our species began to function like a single organism, with humanity\u2019s collective knowledge tower as its brain and each individual human brain like a nerve or a muscle fiber in its body. With the era of mass communication upon us, the collective human organism\u2014the Human Colossus\u2014rose into existence.\n\nWith the entire body of collective human knowledge in its brain, the Human Colossus began inventing things no human could have dreamed of inventing on their own\u2014things that would have seemed like absurd science fiction to people only a few generations before.\nIt turned our ox-drawn carts into speedy locomotives and our horse-and-buggies into shiny metal cars. It turned our lanterns into lightbulbs and written letters into telephone calls and factory workers into industrial machines. It sent us soaring through the skies and out into space. It redefined the meaning of \u201cmass communication\u201d by giving us radio and TV, opening up a world where a thought in someone\u2019s head could be beamed instantly into the brains of a billion people.\nIf an individual human\u2019s core motivation is to pass its genes on, which keeps the species going, the forces of macroeconomics make the Human Colossus\u2019s core motivation to create value, which means it tends to want to invent newer and better technology. Every time it does that, it becomes an even better inventor, which means it can invent new stuff even faster.\nAnd around the middle of the 20th century, the Human Colossus began working on its most ambitious invention yet.\nThe Colossus had figured out a long time ago that the best way to create value was to invent value-creating machines. Machines were better than humans at doing many kinds of work, which generated a flood of new resources that could be put towards value creation. Perhaps even more importantly, machine labor freed up huge portions of human time and energy\u2014i.e. huge portions of the Colossus itself\u2014to focus on innovation. It had already outsourced the work of our arms to factory machines and the work of our legs to driving machines, and it had done so through the power of its brain\u2014now what if, somehow, it could outsource the work of the brain itself to a machine?\nThe first digital computers sprung up in the 1940s.\nOne kind of brain labor computers could do was the work of information storage\u2014they were remembering machines. But we already knew how to outsource our memories using books, just like we had been outsourcing our leg labor to horses long before cars provided a far better solution. Computers were simply a memory-outsourcing upgrade.\nInformation-processing was a different story\u2014a type of brain labor we had never figured out how to outsource. The Human Colossus had always had to do all of its own computing. Computers changed that.\nFactory machines allowed us to outsource a physical process\u2014we put a material in, the machines physically processed it and spit out the results. Computers could do the same thing for information processing. A software program was like a factory machine for information processes.\nThese new information-storage/organizing/processing machines proved to be useful. Computers began to play a central role in the day-to-day operation of companies and governments. By the late 1980s, it was common for individual people to own their own personal brain assistant.\nThen came another leap.\nIn the early 90s, we taught millions of isolated machine-brains how to communicate with one another. They formed a worldwide computer network, and a new giant was born\u2014the Computer Colossus.\n\nThe Computer Colossus and the great network it formed were like popeye spinach for the Human Colossus.\nIf individual human brains are the nerves and muscle fibers of the Human Colossus, the internet gave the giant its first legit nervous system. Each of its nodes was now interconnected to all of its other nodes, and information could travel through the system with light speed. This made the Human Colossus a faster, more fluid thinker.\nThe internet gave billions of humans instant, free, easily-searchable access to the entire human knowledge tower (which by now stretched past the moon). This made the Human Colossus a smarter, faster learner.\nAnd if individual computers had served as brain extensions for individual people, companies, or governments, the Computer Colossus was a brain extension for the entire Human Colossus itself.\n\nWith its first real nervous system, an upgraded brain, and a powerful new tool, the Human Colossus took inventing to a whole new level\u2014and noticing how useful its new computer friend was, it focused a large portion of its efforts on advancing computer technology.\nIt figured out how to make computers faster and cheaper. It made internet faster and wireless. It made computing chips smaller and smaller until there was a powerful computer in everyone\u2019s pocket.\nEach innovation was like a new truckload of spinach for the Human Colossus.\nBut today, the Human Colossus has its eyes set on an even bigger idea than more spinach. Computers have been a game-changer, allowing humanity to outsource many of its brain-related tasks and better function as a single organism. But there\u2019s one kind of brain labor computers still can\u2019t quite do. Thinking.\nComputers can compute and organize and run complex software\u2014software that can even learn on its own. But they can\u2019t think in the way humans can. The Human Colossus knows that everything it\u2019s built has originated with its ability to reason creatively and independently\u2014and it knows that the ultimate brain extension tool would be one that can really, actually, legitimately think. It has no idea what it will be like when the Computer Colossus can think for itself\u2014when it one day opens its eyes and becomes a real colossus\u2014but with its core goal to create value and push technology to its limits, the Human Colossus is determined to find out.\n___________\nWe\u2019ll come back here in a bit. First, we have some learning to do.\nAs we\u2019ve discussed before, knowledge works like a tree. If you try to learn a branch or a leaf of a topic before you have a solid tree trunk foundation of understanding in your head, it won\u2019t work. The branches and leaves will have nothing to stick to, so they\u2019ll fall right out of your head.\nWe\u2019ve established that Elon Musk wants to build a wizard hat for the brain, and understanding why he wants to do that is the key to understanding Neuralink\u2014and to understanding what our future might actually be like.\nBut none of that will make much sense until we really get into the truly mind-blowing concept of what a wizard hat is, what it might be like to wear one, and how we get there from where we are today.\nThe foundation for that discussion is an understanding of what brain-machine interfaces are, how they work, and where the technology is today.\nFinally, BMIs themselves are just a larger branch\u2014not the tree\u2019s trunk. In order to really understand BMIs and how they work, we need to understand the brain. Getting how the brain works is our tree trunk.\n\nSo we\u2019ll start with the brain, which will prepare us to learn about BMIs, which will teach us about what it\u2019ll take to build a wizard hat, and that\u2019ll set things up for an insane discussion about the future\u2014which will get our heads right where they need to be to wrap themselves around why Elon thinks a wizard hat is such a critical piece of our future. And by the time we reach the end, this whole thing should click into place.\nPart 2: The Brain\n\nThis post was a nice reminder of why I like working with a brain that looks nice and cute like this:\n\nBecause the real brain is extremely uncute and upsetting-looking. People are gross.\nBut I\u2019ve been living in a shimmery, oozy, blood-vessel-lined Google Images hell for the past month, and now you have to deal with it too. So just settle in.\nWe\u2019ll start outside the head. One thing I will give to biology is that it\u2019s sometimes very satisfying,5 and the brain has some satisfying things going on. The first of which is that there\u2019s a real Russian doll situation going on with your head.\nYou have your hair, and under that is your scalp, and then you think your skull comes next\u2014but it\u2019s actually like 19 things and then your skull:3\n\nThen below your skull,6 another whole bunch of things are going on before you get to the brain4:\n\nYour brain has three membranes around it underneath the skull:\nOn the outside, there\u2019s the dura mater (which means \u201chard mother\u201d in Latin), a firm, rugged, waterproof layer. The dura is flush with the skull. I\u2019ve heard it said that the brain has no pain sensory area, but the dura actually does\u2014it\u2019s about as sensitive as the skin on your face\u2014and pressure on or contusions in the dura often account for people\u2019s bad headaches.\nThen below that there\u2019s the arachnoid mater (\u201cspider mother\u201d), which is a layer of skin and then an open space with these stretchy-looking fibers. I always thought my brain was just floating aimlessly in my head in some kind of fluid, but actually, the only real space gap between the outside of the brain and the inner wall of the skull is this arachnoid business. Those fibers stabilize the brain in position so it can\u2019t move too much, and they act as a shock absorber when your head bumps into something. This area is filled with spinal fluid, which keeps the brain mostly buoyant, since its density is similar to that of water.\nFinally you have the pia mater (\u201csoft mother\u201d), a fine, delicate layer of skin that\u2019s fused with the outside of the brain. You know how when you see a brain, it\u2019s always covered with icky blood vessels? Those aren\u2019t actually on the brain\u2019s surface, they\u2019re embedded in the pia. (For the non-squeamish, here\u2019s a video of a professor peeling the pia off of a human brain.)\nHere\u2019s the full overview, using the head of what looks like probably a pig:\n\nFrom the left you have the skin (the pink), then two scalp layers, then the skull, then the dura, arachnoid, and on the far right, just the brain covered by the pia.\nOnce we\u2019ve stripped everything down, we\u2019re left with this silly boy:5\n\nThis ridiculous-looking thing is the most complex known object in the universe\u2014three pounds of what neuroengineer Tim Hanson calls \u201cone of the most information-dense, structured, and self-structuring matter known.\u201d6 All while operating on only 20 watts of power (an equivalently powerful computer runs on 24,000,000 watts).\nIt\u2019s also what MIT professor Polina Anikeeva calls \u201csoft pudding you could scoop with a spoon.\u201d Brain surgeon Ben Rapoport described it to me more scientifically, as \u201csomewhere between pudding and jello.\u201d He explained that if you placed a brain on a table, gravity would make it lose its shape and flatten out a bit, kind of like a jellyfish. We often don\u2019t think of the brain as so smooshy, because it\u2019s normally suspended in water.\nBut this is what we all are. You look in the mirror and see your body and your face and you think that\u2019s you\u2014but that\u2019s really just the machine you\u2019re riding in. What you actually are is a zany-looking ball of jello. I hope that\u2019s okay.\nAnd given how weird that is, you can\u2019t really blame Aristotle, or the ancient Egyptians, or many others, for assuming that the brain was somewhat-meaningless \u201ccranial stuffing\u201d (Aristotle believed the heart was the center of intelligence).7\nEventually, humans figured out the deal. But only kind of.\nProfessor Krishna Shenoy likens our understanding of the brain to humanity\u2019s grasp on the world map in the early 1500s.\nAnother professor, Jeff Lichtman, is even harsher. He starts off his courses by asking his students the question, \u201cIf everything you need to know about the brain is a mile, how far have we walked in this mile?\u201d He says students give answers like three-quarters of a mile, half a mile, a quarter of a mile, etc.\u2014but that he believes the real answer is \u201cabout three inches.\u201d8\n\nA third professor, neuroscientist Moran Cerf, shared with me an old neuroscience saying that points out why trying to master the brain is a bit of a catch-22: \u201cIf the human brain were so simple that we could understand it, we would be so simple that we couldn\u2019t.\u201d\nMaybe with the help of the great knowledge tower our species is building, we can get there at some point. For now, let\u2019s go through what we do currently know about the jellyfish in our heads\u2014starting with the big picture.\nThe brain, zoomed out\nLet\u2019s look at the major sections of the brain using a hemisphere cross section. So this is what the brain looks like in your head:\n\nNow let\u2019s take the brain out of the head and remove the left hemisphere, which gives us a good view of the inside.9\n\nNeurologist Paul MacLean made a simple diagram that illustrates the basic idea we talked about earlier of the reptile brain coming first in evolution, then being built upon by mammals, and finally being built upon again to give us our brain trifecta.\n\nHere\u2019s how this essentially maps out on our real brain:\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at each section:\nThe Reptilian Brain: The Brain Stem (and Cerebellum)\nThis is the most ancient part of our brain:10\n\nThat\u2019s the section of our brain cross section above that the frog boss resides over. In fact, a frog\u2019s entire brain is similar to this lower part of our brain. Here\u2019s a real frog brain:11\n\nWhen you understand the function of these parts, the fact that they\u2019re ancient makes sense\u2014everything these parts do, frogs and lizards can do. These are the major sections (click any of these spinning images to see a high-res version):\nThe medulla oblongata \nThe medulla oblongata really just wants you to not die. It does the thankless tasks of controlling involuntary things like your heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure, along with making you vomit when it thinks you\u2019ve been poisoned.\nThe pons \nThe pons\u2019s thing is that it does a little bit of this and a little bit of that. It deals with swallowing, bladder control, facial expressions, chewing, saliva, tears, and posture\u2014really just whatever it\u2019s in the mood for.\nThe midbrain \nThe midbrain is dealing with an even bigger identity crisis than the pons. You know a brain part is going through some shit when almost all its functions are already another brain part\u2019s thing. In the case of the midbrain, it deals with vision, hearing, motor control, alertness, temperature control, and a bunch of other things that other people in the brain already do. The rest of the brain doesn\u2019t seem very into the midbrain either, given that they created a ridiculously uneven \u201cforebrain, midbrain, hindbrain\u201d divide that intentionally isolates the midbrain all by itself while everyone else hangs out.12\n\nOne thing I\u2019ll grant the pons and midbrain is that it\u2019s the two of them that control your voluntary eye movement, which is a pretty legit job. So if right now you move your eyes around, that\u2019s you doing something specifically with your pons and midbrain.7\nThe cerebellum \nThe odd-looking thing that looks like your brain\u2019s scrotum is your cerebellum (Latin for \u201clittle brain\u201d), which makes sure you stay a balanced, coordinated, and normal-moving person. Here\u2019s that rad professor again showing you what a real cerebellum looks like.8\nThe Paleo-Mammalian Brain: The Limbic System\nAbove the brain stem is the limbic system\u2014the part of the brain that makes humans so insane.13\n\nThe limbic system is a survival system. A decent rule of thumb is that whenever you\u2019re doing something that your dog might also do\u2014eating, drinking, having sex, fighting, hiding or running away from something scary\u2014your limbic system is probably behind the wheel. Whether it feels like it or not, when you\u2019re doing any of those things, you\u2019re in primitive survival mode.\nThe limbic system is also where your emotions live, and in the end, emotions are also all about survival\u2014they\u2019re the more advanced mechanisms of survival, necessary for animals living in a complex social structure.\nIn other posts, when I refer to your Instant Gratification Monkey, your Social Survival Mammoth, and all your other animals\u2014I\u2019m usually referring to your limbic system. Anytime there\u2019s an internal battle going on in your head, it\u2019s likely that the limbic system\u2019s role is urging you to do the thing you\u2019ll later regret doing.\nI\u2019m pretty sure that gaining control over your limbic system is both the definition of maturity and the core human struggle. It\u2019s not that we would be better off without our limbic systems\u2014limbic systems are half of what makes us distinctly human, and most of the fun of life is related to emotions and/or fulfilling your animal needs\u2014it\u2019s just that your limbic system doesn\u2019t get that you live in a civilization, and if you let it run your life too much, it\u2019ll quickly ruin your life.\nAnyway, let\u2019s take a closer look at it. There are a lot of little parts of the limbic system, but we\u2019ll keep it to the biggest celebrities:\nThe amygdala  \nThe amygdala is kind of an emotional wreck of a brain structure. It deals with anxiety, sadness, and our responses to fear. There are two amygdalae, and oddly, the left one has been shown to be more balanced, sometimes producing happy feelings in addition to the usual angsty ones, while the right one is always in a bad mood.\nThe hippocampus  \nYour hippocampus (Greek for \u201cseahorse\u201d because it looks like one) is like a scratch board for memory. When rats start to memorize directions in a maze, the memory gets encoded in their hippocampus\u2014quite literally. Different parts of the rat\u2019s two hippocampi will fire during different parts of the maze, since each section of the maze is stored in its own section of the hippocampus. But if after learning one maze, the rat is given other tasks and is brought back to the original maze a year later, it will have a hard time remembering it, because the hippocampus scratch board has been mostly wiped of the memory so as to free itself up for new memories.\nThe condition in the movie Memento is a real thing\u2014anterograde amnesia\u2014and it\u2019s caused by damage to the hippocampus. Alzheimer\u2019s also starts in the hippocampus before working its way through many parts of the brain, which is why, of the slew of devastating effects of the disease, diminished memory happens first.\nThe thalamus \nIn its central position in the brain, the thalamus also serves as a sensory middleman that receives information from your sensory organs and sends them to your cortex for processing. When you\u2019re sleeping, the thalamus goes to sleep with you, which means the sensory middleman is off duty. That\u2019s why in a deep sleep, some sound or light or touch often will not wake you up. If you want to wake someone up who\u2019s in a deep sleep, you have to be aggressive enough to wake their thalamus up.\nThe exception is your sense of smell, which is the one sense that bypasses the thalamus. That\u2019s why smelling salts are used to wake up a passed-out person. While we\u2019re here, cool fact: smell is the function of the olfactory bulb and is the most ancient of the senses. Unlike the other senses, smell is located deep in the limbic system, where it works closely with the hippocampus and amygdala\u2014which is why smell is so closely tied to memory and emotion.\nThe Neo-Mammalian Brain: The Cortex\nFinally, we arrive at the cortex. The cerebral cortex. The neocortex. The cerebrum. The pallium.\nThe most important part of the whole brain can\u2019t figure out what its name is. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening:\n\nThe What the Hell is it Actually Called Blue Box\nThe cerebrum is the whole big top/outside part of the brain but it also technically includes some of the internal parts too.\nCortex means \u201cbark\u201d in Latin and is the word used for the outer layer of many organs, not just the brain. The outside of the cerebellum is the cerebellar cortex. And the outside of the cerebrum is the cerebral cortex. Only mammals have cerebral cortices. The equivalent part of the brain in reptiles is called the pallium. \nThe neocortex is often used interchangeably with \u201ccerebral cortex,\u201d but it\u2019s technically the outer layers of the cerebral cortex that are especially developed in more advanced mammals. The other parts are called the allocortex.\nIn the rest of this post, we\u2019ll be mostly referring to the neocortex but we\u2019ll just call it the cortex, since that\u2019s the least annoying way to do it for everyone.\n\nThe cortex is in charge of basically everything\u2014processing what you see, hear, and feel, along with language, movement, thinking, planning, and personality.\nIt\u2019s divided into four lobes:14\n\nIt\u2019s pretty unsatisfying to describe what they each do, because they each do so many things and there\u2019s a lot of overlap, but to oversimplify:\nThe frontal lobe (click the words to see a gif) handles your personality, along with a lot of what we think of as \u201cthinking\u201d\u2014reasoning, planning, and executive function. In particular, a lot of your thinking takes place in the front part of the frontal lobe, called the prefrontal cortex\u2014the adult in your head. The prefrontal cortex is the other character in those internal battles that go on in your life. The rational decision-maker trying to get you to do your work. The authentic voice trying to get you to stop worrying so much what others think and just be yourself. The higher being who wishes you\u2019d stop sweating the small stuff.\nAs if that\u2019s not enough to worry about, the frontal lobe is also in charge of your body\u2019s movement. The top strip of the frontal lobe is your primary motor cortex.15\n\nThen there\u2019s the parietal lobe which, among other things, controls your sense of touch, particularly in the primary somatosensory cortex, the strip right next to the primary motor cortex.16\n\nThe motor and somatosensory cortices are fun because they\u2019re well-mapped. Neuroscientists know exactly which part of each strip connects to each part of your body. Which leads us to the creepiest diagram of this post: the homunculus.\n\nThe homunculus, created by pioneer neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield, visually displays how the motor and somatosensory cortices are mapped. The larger the body part in the diagram, the more of the cortex is dedicated to its movement or sense of touch. A couple interesting things about this:\nFirst, it\u2019s amazing that more of your brain is dedicated to the movement and feeling of your face and hands than to the rest of your body combined. This makes sense though\u2014you need to make incredibly nuanced facial expressions and your hands need to be unbelievably dexterous, while the rest of your body\u2014your shoulder, your knee, your back\u2014can move and feel things much more crudely. This is why people can play the piano with their fingers but not with their toes.\nSecond, it\u2019s interesting how the two cortices are basically dedicated to the same body parts, in the same proportions. I never really thought about the fact that the same parts of your body you need to have a lot of movement control over tend to also be the most sensitive to touch.\nFinally, I came across this shit and I\u2019ve been living with it ever since\u2014so now you have to too. A 3-dimensional homunculus man.17\n\nMoving on\u2014\nThe temporal lobe is where a lot of your memory lives, and being right next to your ears, it\u2019s also the home of your auditory cortex. \nLast, at the back of your head is the occipital lobe, which houses your visual cortex and is almost entirely dedicated to vision.\nNow for a long time, I thought these major lobes were chunks of the brain\u2014like, segments of the whole 3D structure. But actually, the cortex is just the outer two millimeters of the brain\u2014the thickness of a nickel\u2014and the meat of the space underneath is mostly just wiring.\n\nThe Why Brains Are So Wrinkly Blue Box\nAs we\u2019ve discussed, the evolution of our brain happened by building outwards, adding newer, fancier features on top of the existing model. But building outwards has its limits, because the need for humans to emerge into the world through someone\u2019s vagina puts a cap on how big our heads could be.9\nSo evolution got innovative. Because the cortex is so thin, it scales by increasing its surface area. That means that by creating lots of folds (including both sides folding down into the gap between the two hemispheres), you can more than triple the area of the brain\u2019s surface without increasing the volume too much. When the brain first develops in the womb, the cortex is smooth\u2014the folds form mostly in the last two months of pregnancy:18\n\nCool explainer of how the folds form here.\n\nIf you could take the cortex off the brain, you\u2019d end up with a 2mm-thick sheet with an area of 2,000-2,400cm2\u2014about the size of a 48cm x 48cm (19in x 19in) square.10 A dinner napkin. \nThis napkin is where most of the action in your brain happens\u2014it\u2019s why you can think, move, feel, see, hear, remember, and speak and understand language. Best napkin ever.\nAnd remember before when I said that you were a jello ball? Well the you you think of when you think of yourself\u2014it\u2019s really mainly your cortex. Which means you\u2019re actually a napkin.\nThe magic of the folds in increasing the napkin\u2019s size is clear when we put another brain on top of our stripped-off cortex:\n\nSo while it\u2019s not perfect, modern science has a decent understanding of the big picture when it comes to the brain. We also have a decent understanding of the little picture. Let\u2019s check it out:\nThe brain, zoomed in\nEven though we figured out that the brain was the seat of our intelligence a long time ago, it wasn\u2019t until pretty recently that science understood what the brain was made of. Scientists knew that the body was made of cells, but in the late 19th century, Italian physician Camillo Golgi figured out how to use a staining method to see what brain cells actually looked like. The result was surprising:\n\nThat wasn\u2019t what a cell was supposed to look like. Without quite realizing it yet,11 Golgi had discovered the neuron.\nScientists realized that the neuron was the core unit in the vast communication network that makes up the brains and nervous systems of nearly all animals.\nBut it wasn\u2019t until the 1950s that scientists worked out how neurons communicate with each other.\nAn axon, the long strand of a neuron that carries information, is normally microscopic in diameter\u2014too small for scientists to test on until recently. But in the 1930s, English zoologist J. Z. Young discovered that the squid, randomly, could change everything for our understanding, because squids have an unusually huge axon in their bodies that could be experimented on. A couple decades later, using the squid\u2019s giant axon, scientists Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley definitively figured out how neurons send information: the action potential. Here\u2019s how it works.\nSo there are a lot of different kinds of neurons\u201419\n\n\u2014but for simplicity, we\u2019ll discuss the clich\u00e9 textbook neuron\u2014a pyramidal cell, like one you might find in your motor cortex. To make a neuron diagram, we can start with a guy:\n\nAnd then if we just give him a few extra legs, some hair, take his arms off, and stretch him out\u2014we have a neuron.\n\nAnd let\u2019s add in a few more neurons.\n\nRather than launch into the full, detailed explanation for how action potentials work\u2014which involves a lot of unnecessary and uninteresting technical information you already dealt with in 9th-grade biology\u2014I\u2019ll link to this great Khan Academy explainer article for those who want the full story. We\u2019ll go through the very basic ideas that are relevant for our purposes.\nSo our guy\u2019s body stem\u2014the neuron\u2019s axon\u2014has a negative \u201cresting potential,\u201d which means that when it\u2019s at rest, its electrical charge is slightly negative. At all times, a bunch of people\u2019s feet keep touching12 our guy\u2019s hair\u2014the neuron\u2019s dendrites\u2014whether he likes it or not. Their feet drop chemicals called neurotransmitters13 onto his hair\u2014which pass through his head (the cell body, or soma) and, depending on the chemical, raise or lower the charge in his body a little bit. It\u2019s a little unpleasant for our neuron guy, but not a huge deal\u2014and nothing else happens.\n\nBut if enough chemicals touch his hair to raise his charge over a certain point\u2014the neuron\u2019s \u201cthreshold potential\u201d\u2014then it triggers an action potential, and our guy is electrocuted.\n\nThis is a binary situation\u2014either nothing happens to our guy, or he\u2019s fully electrocuted. He can\u2019t be kind of electrocuted, or extra electrocuted\u2014he\u2019s either not electrocuted at all, or he\u2019s fully electrocuted to the exact same degree every time.\nWhen this happens, a pulse of electricity (in the form of a brief reversal of his body\u2019s normal charge from negative to positive and then rapidly back down to his normal negative) zips down his body (the axon) and into his feet\u2014the neuron\u2019s axon terminals\u2014which themselves touch a bunch of other people\u2019s hair (the points of contact are called synapses). When the action potential reaches his feet, it causes them to release chemicals onto the people\u2019s hair they\u2019re touching, which may or may not cause those people to be electrocuted, just like he was.\n\nThis is usually how info moves through the nervous system\u2014chemical information sent in the tiny gap between neurons triggers electrical information to pass through the neuron\u2014but sometimes, in situations when the body needs to move a signal extra quickly, neuron-to-neuron connections can themselves be electric.\nAction potentials move at between 1 and 100 meters/second. Part of the reason for this large range is that another type of cell in the nervous system\u2014a Schwann cell\u2014acts like a super nurturing grandmother and constantly wraps some types of axons in layers of fat blankets called myelin sheath. Like this (takes a second to start):20\n\nOn top of its protection and insulation benefits, the myelin sheath is a major factor in the pace of communication\u2014action potentials travel much faster through axons when they\u2019re covered in myelin sheath:1421\n\nOne nice example of the speed difference created by myelin: You know how when you stub your toe, your body gives you that one second of reflection time to think about what you just did and what you\u2019re about to feel, before the pain actually kicks in? What\u2019s happening is you feel both the sensation of your toe hitting against something and the sharp part of the pain right away, because sharp pain information is sent to the brain via types of axons that are myelinated. It takes a second or two for the dull pain to kick in because dull pain is sent via unmyelinated \u201cC fibers\u201d\u2014at only around one meter/second.\nNeural Networks\nNeurons are similar to computer transistors in one way\u2014they also transmit information in the binary language of 1\u2019s (action potential firing) and 0\u2019s (no action potential firing). But unlike computer transistors, the brain\u2019s neurons are constantly changing.\nYou know how sometimes you learn a new skill and you get pretty good at it, and then the next day you try again and you suck again? That\u2019s because what made you get good at the skill the day before was adjustments to the amount or concentration of the chemicals in the signaling between neurons. Repetition caused chemicals to adjust, which helped you improve, but the next day the chemicals were back to normal so the improvement went away.\nBut then if you keep practicing, you eventually get good at something in a lasting way. What\u2019s happened is you\u2019ve told the brain, \u201cthis isn\u2019t just something I need in a one-off way,\u201d and the brain\u2019s neural network has responded by making structural changes to itself that last. Neurons have shifted shape and location and strengthened or weakened various connections in a way that has built a hard-wired set of pathways that know how to do that skill.\nNeurons\u2019 ability to alter themselves chemically, structurally, and even functionally, allow your brain\u2019s neural network to optimize itself to the external world\u2014a phenomenon called neuroplasticity. Babies\u2019 brains are the most neuroplastic of all. When a baby is born, its brain has no idea if it needs to accommodate the life of a medieval warrior who will need to become incredibly adept at sword-fighting, a 17th-century musician who will need to develop fine-tuned muscle memory for playing the harpsichord, or a modern-day intellectual who will need to store and organize a tremendous amount of information and master a complex social fabric\u2014but the baby\u2019s brain is ready to shape itself to handle whatever life has in store for it.\nBabies are the neuroplasticity superstars, but neuroplasticity remains throughout our whole lives, which is why humans can grow and change and learn new things. And it\u2019s why we can form new habits and break old ones\u2014your habits are reflective of the existing circuitry in your brain. If you want to change your habits, you need to exert a lot of willpower to override your brain\u2019s neural pathways, but if you can keep it going long enough, your brain will eventually get the hint and alter those pathways, and the new behavior will stop requiring willpower. Your brain will have physically built the changes into a new habit.\nAltogether, there are around 100 billion neurons in the brain that make up this unthinkably vast network\u2014similar to the number of stars in the Milky Way and over 10 times the number of people in the world. Around 15 \u2013 20 billion of those neurons are in the cortex, and the rest are in the animal parts of your brain (surprisingly, the random cerebellum has more than three times as many neurons as the cortex).\nLet\u2019s zoom back out and look at another cross section of the brain\u2014this time cut not from front to back to show a single hemisphere, but from side to side:22\n\nBrain material can be divided into what\u2019s called gray matter and white matter. Gray matter actually looks darker in color and is made up of the cell bodies (somas) of the brain\u2019s neurons and their thicket of dendrites and axons\u2014along with a lot of other stuff. White matter is made up primarily of wiring\u2014axons carrying information from somas to other somas or to destinations in the body. White matter is white because those axons are usually wrapped in myelin sheath, which is fatty white tissue.\nThere are two main regions of gray matter in the brain\u2014the internal cluster of limbic system and brain stem parts we discussed above, and the nickel-thick layer of cortex around the outside. The big chunk of white matter in between is made up mostly of the axons of cortical neurons. The cortex is like a great command center, and it beams many of its orders out through the mass of axons making up the white matter beneath it.\nThe coolest illustration of this concept that I\u2019ve come across15 is a beautiful set of artistic representations done by Dr. Greg A. Dunn and Dr. Brian Edwards. Check out the distinct difference between the structure of the outer layer of gray matter cortex and the white matter underneath it (click to view in high res):\n \nThose cortical axons might be taking information to another part of the cortex, to the lower part of the brain, or through the spinal cord\u2014the nervous system\u2019s superhighway\u2014and into the rest of the body.16\nLet\u2019s look at the whole nervous system:23\n\nThe nervous system is divided into two parts: the central nervous system\u2014your brain and spinal cord\u2014and the peripheral nervous system\u2014made up of the neurons that radiate outwards from the spinal cord into the rest of the body.\nMost types of neurons are interneurons\u2014neurons that communicate with other neurons. When you think, it\u2019s a bunch of interneurons talking to each other. Interneurons are mostly contained to the brain.\nThe two other kinds of neurons are sensory neurons and motor neurons\u2014those are the neurons that head down into your spinal cord and make up the peripheral nervous system. These neurons can be up to a meter long.17 Here\u2019s a typical structure of each type:24\n\nRemember our two strips?25\n\nThese strips are where your peripheral nervous system originates. The axons of sensory neurons head down from the somatosensory cortex, through the brain\u2019s white matter, and into the spinal cord (which is just a massive bundle of axons). From the spinal cord, they head out to all parts of your body. Each part of your skin is lined with nerves that originate in the somatosensory cortex. A nerve, by the way, is a few bundles of axons wrapped together in a little cord. Here\u2019s a nerve up close:26\n\nThe nerve is the whole thing circled in purple, and those four big circles inside are bundles of many axons (here\u2019s a helpful cartoony drawing).\nSo if a fly lands on your arm, here\u2019s what happens:\nThe fly touches your skin and stimulates a bunch of sensory nerves. The axon terminals in the nerves have a little fit and start action potential-ing, sending the signal up to the brain to tell on the fly. The signals head into the spinal cord and up to the somas in the somatosensory cortex.18 The somatosensory cortex then taps the motor cortex on the shoulder and tells it that there\u2019s a fly on your arm and that it needs to deal with it (lazy). The particular somas in your motor cortex that connect to the muscles in your arm then start action potential-ing, sending the signals back into the spinal cord and then out to the muscles of the arm. The axon terminals at the end of those neurons stimulate your arm muscles, which constrict to shake your arm to get the fly off (by now the fly has already thrown up on your arm), and the fly (whose nervous system now goes through its own whole thing) flies off.\nThen your amygdala looks over and realizes there was a bug on you, and it tells your motor cortex to jump embarrassingly, and if it\u2019s a spider instead of a fly, it also tells your vocal cords to yell out involuntarily and ruin your reputation.\nSo it seems so far like we do kind of actually understand the brain, right? But then why did that professor ask that question\u2014If everything you need to know about the brain is a mile, how far have we walked in this mile?\u2014and say the answer was three inches?\nWell here\u2019s the thing.\nYou know how we totally get how an individual computer sends an email and we totally understand the broad concepts of the internet, like how many people are on it and what the biggest sites are and what the major trends are\u2014but all the stuff in the middle\u2014the inner workings of the internet\u2014are pretty confusing?\nAnd you know how economists can tell you all about how an individual consumer functions and they can also tell you about the major concepts of macroeconomics and the overarching forces at play\u2014but no one can really tell you all the ins and outs of how the economy works or predict what will happen with the economy next month or next year?\nThe brain is kind of like those things. We get the little picture\u2014we know all about how a neuron fires. And we get the big picture\u2014we know how many neurons are in the brain and what the major lobes and structures control and how much energy the whole system uses. But the stuff in between\u2014all that middle stuff about how each part of the brain actually does its thing?\nYeah we don\u2019t get that.\nWhat really makes it clear how confounded we are is hearing a neuroscientist talk about the parts of the brain we understand best.\nLike the visual cortex. We understand the visual cortex pretty well because it\u2019s easy to map.\nResearch scientist Paul Merolla described it to me:\nThe visual cortex has very nice anatomical function and structure. When you look at it, you literally see a map of the world. So when something in your visual field is in a certain region of space, you\u2019ll see a little patch in the cortex that represents that region of space, and it\u2019ll light up. And as that thing moves over, there\u2019s a topographic mapping where the neighboring cells will represent that. It\u2019s almost like having Cartesian coordinates of the real world that will map to polar coordinates in the visual cortex. And you can literally trace from your retina, through your thalamus, to your visual cortex, and you\u2019ll see an actual mapping from this point in space to this point in the visual cortex.\nSo far so good. But then he went on:\nSo that mapping is really useful if you want to interact with certain parts of the visual cortex, but there\u2019s many regions of vision, and as you get deeper into the visual cortex, it becomes a little bit more nebulous, and this topographic representation starts to break down. \u2026 There\u2019s all these levels of things going on in the brain, and visual perception is a great example of that. We look at the world, and there\u2019s just this physical 3D world out there\u2014like you look at a cup, and you just see a cup\u2014but what your eyes are seeing is really just a bunch of pixels. And when you look in the visual cortex, you see that there are roughly 20-40 different maps. V1 is the first area, where it\u2019s tracking little edges and colors and things like that. And there\u2019s other areas looking at more complicated objects, and there\u2019s all these different visual representations on the surface of your brain, that you can see. And somehow all of that information is being bound together in this information stream that\u2019s being coded in a way that makes you believe you\u2019re just seeing a simple object.\nAnd the motor cortex, another one of the best-understood areas of the brain, might be even more difficult to understand on a granular level than the visual cortex. Because even though we know which general areas of the motor cortex map to which areas of the body, the individual neurons in these motor cortex areas aren\u2019t topographically set up, and the specific way they work together to create movement in the body is anything but clear. Here\u2019s Paul again:\nThe neural chatter in everyone\u2019s arm movement part of the brain is a little bit different\u2014it\u2019s not like the neurons speak English and say \u201cmove\u201d\u2014it\u2019s a pattern of electrical activity, and in everyone it\u2019s a little bit different. \u2026 And you want to be able to seamlessly understand that it means \u201cMove the arm this way\u201d or \u201cmove the arm toward the target\u201d or \u201cmove the arm to the left, move it up, grasp, grasp with a certain kind of force, reach with a certain speed,\u201d and so on. We don\u2019t think about these things when we move\u2014it just happens seamlessly. So each brain has a unique code with which it talks to the muscles in the arm and hand.\nThe neuroplasticity that makes our brains so useful to us also makes them incredibly difficult to understand\u2014because the way each of our brains works is based on how that brain has shaped itself, based on its particular environment and life experience.\nAnd again, those are the areas of the brain we understand the best. \u201cWhen it comes to more sophisticated computation, like language, memory, mathematics,\u201d one expert told me, \u201cwe really don\u2019t understand how the brain works.\u201d He lamented that, for example, the concept of one\u2019s mother is coded in a different way, and in different parts of the brain, for every person. And in the frontal lobe\u2014you know, that part of the brain where you really live\u2014\u201dthere\u2019s no topography at all.\u201d \nBut somehow, none of this is why building effective brain-computer interfaces is so hard, or so daunting. What makes BMIs so hard is that the engineering challenges are monumental. It\u2019s physically working with the brain that makes BMIs among the hardest engineering endeavors in the world.\n\nSo with our brain background tree trunk built, we\u2019re ready to head up to our first branch.\nPart 3: Brain-Machine Interfaces\n\nLet\u2019s zip back in time for a second to 50,000 BC and kidnap someone and bring him back here to 2017.\n\nThis is Bok. Bok, we\u2019re really thankful that you and your people invented language.\n\nAs a way to thank you, we want to show you all the amazing things we were able to build because of your invention.\n\nAlright, first let\u2019s take Bok on a plane, and into a submarine, and to the top of the Burj Khalifa. Now we\u2019ll show him a telescope and a TV and an iPhone. And now we\u2019ll let him play around on the internet for a while.\nOkay that was fun. How\u2019d it go, Bok?\n\nYeah we figured that you\u2019d be pretty surprised. To wrap up, let\u2019s show him how we communicate with each other.\n    \nBok would be shocked to learn that despite all the magical powers humans have gained as a result of having learned to speak to each other, when it comes to actually speaking to each other, we\u2019re no more magical than the people of his day. When two people are together and talking, they\u2019re using 50,000-year-old technology.\nBok might also be surprised that in a world run by fancy machines, the people who made all the machines are walking around with the same biological bodies that Bok and his friends walk around with. How can that be?\n\nThis is why brain-machine interfaces\u2014a subset of the broader field of neural engineering, which itself is a subset of biotechnology\u2014are such a tantalizing new industry. We\u2019ve conquered the world many times over with our technology, but when it comes to our brains\u2014our most central tool\u2014the tech world has for the most part been too daunted to dive in.\nThat\u2019s why we still communicate using technology Bok invented, it\u2019s why I\u2019m typing this sentence at about a 20th of the speed that I\u2019m thinking it, and it\u2019s why brain-related ailments still leave so many lives badly impaired or lost altogether.\nBut 50,000 years after the brain\u2019s great \u201caha!\u201d moment, that may finally be about to change. The brain\u2019s next great frontier may be itself.\n___________\nThere are many kinds of potential brain-machine interface (sometimes called a brain-computer interface) that will serve many different functions. But everyone working on BMIs is grappling with either one or both of these two questions:\n1) How do I get the right information out of the brain?\n2) How do I send the right information into the brain?\nThe first is about capturing the brain\u2019s output\u2014it\u2019s about recording what neurons are saying.\nThe second is about inputting information into the brain\u2019s natural flow or altering that natural flow in some other way\u2014it\u2019s about stimulating neurons.\nThese two things are happening naturally in your brain all the time. Right now, your eyes are making a specific set of horizontal movements that allow you to read this sentence. That\u2019s the brain\u2019s neurons outputting information to a machine (your eyes) and the machine receiving the command and responding. And as your eyes move in just the right way, the photons from the screen are entering your retinas and stimulating neurons in the occipital lobe of your cortex in a way that allows the image of the words to enter your mind\u2019s eye. That image then stimulates neurons in another part of your brain that allows you to process the information embedded in the image and absorb the sentence\u2019s meaning.\nInputting and outputting information is what the brain\u2019s neurons do. All the BMI industry wants to do is get in on the action.\nAt first, this seems like maybe not that difficult a task? The brain is just a jello ball, right? And the cortex\u2014the part of the brain in which we want to do most of our recording and stimulating\u2014is just a napkin, located conveniently right on the outside of the brain where it can be easily accessed. Inside the cortex are around 20 billion firing neurons\u201420 billion oozy little transistors that if we can just learn to work with, will give us an entirely new level of control over our life, our health, and the world. Can\u2019t we figure that out? Neurons are small, but we know how to split an atom. A neuron\u2019s diameter is about 100,000 times as large as an atom\u2019s\u2014if an atom were a marble, a neuron would be a kilometer across\u2014so we should probably be able to handle the smallness. Right?\nSo what\u2019s the issue here?\nWell on one hand, there\u2019s something to that line of thinking, in that because of those facts, this is an industry where immense progress can happen. We can do this.\nBut only when you understand what actually goes on in the brain do you realize why this is probably the hardest human endeavor in the world.\nSo before we talk about BMIs themselves, we need to take a closer look at what the people trying to make BMIs are dealing with here. I find that the best way to illustrate things is to scale the brain up by exactly 1,000X and look at what\u2019s going on.\nRemember our cortex-is-a-napkin demonstration earlier?\n\nWell if we scale that up by 1,000X, the cortex napkin\u2014which was about 48cm / 19in on each side\u2014now has a side the length of six Manhattan street blocks (or two avenue blocks). It would take you about 25 minutes to walk around the perimeter. And the brain as a whole would now fit snugly inside a two block by two block square\u2014just about the size of Madison Square Garden (this works in length and width, but the brain would be about double the height of MSG).\n\nSo let\u2019s lay it out in the actual city. I\u2019m sure the few hundred thousand people who live there will understand.\n\nI chose 1,000X as our multiplier for a couple reasons. One is that we can all instantly convert the sizes in our heads. Every millimeter of the actual brain is now a meter. And in the much smaller world of neurons, every micron is now an easy-to-conceptualize millimeter. Secondly, it conveniently brings the cortex up to human size\u2014its 2mm thickness is now two meters\u2014the height of a tall (6\u20196\u201d) man.\nSo we could walk up to 29th street, to the edge of our giant cortex napkin, and easily look at what was going on inside those two meters of thickness. For our demonstration, let\u2019s pull out a cubic meter of our giant cortex to examine, which will show us what goes on in a typical cubic millimeter of real cortex.\n\nWhat we\u2019d see in that cubic meter would be a mess. Let\u2019s empty it out and put it back together.\nFirst, let\u2019s put the somas19 in\u2014the little bodies of all the neurons that live in that cube.\nSomas range in size, but the neuroscientists I spoke with said that the somas of neurons in the cortex are often around 10 or 15\u00b5m in diameter (\u00b5m = micrometer, or micron: 1/1,000th of a millimeter). That means that if you laid out 7 or 10 of them in a line, that line would be about the diameter of a human hair (which is about 100\u00b5m). On our scale, that makes a soma 1 \u2013 1.5cm in diameter. A marble.\nThe volume of the whole cortex is in the ballpark of 500,000 cubic millimeters, and in that space are about 20 billion somas. That means an average cubic millimeter of cortex contains about 40,000 neurons. So there are 40,000 marbles in our cubic meter box. If we divide our box into about 40,000 cubic spaces, each with a side of 3cm (or about a cubic inch), it means each of our soma marbles is at the center of its own little 3cm cube, with other somas about 3cm away from it in all directions.\nWith me so far? Can you visualize our meter cube with those 40,000 floating marbles in it?\nHere\u2019s a microscope image of the somas in an actual cortex, using techniques that block out the other stuff around them:27\n\nOkay not too crazy so far. But the soma is only a tiny piece of each neuron. Radiating out from each of our marble-sized somas are twisty, branchy dendrites that in our scaled-up brain can stretch out for three or four meters in many different directions, and from the other end an axon that can be over 100 meters long (when heading out laterally to another part of the cortex) or as long as a kilometer (when heading down into the spinal cord and body). Each of them only about a millimeter thick, these cords turn the cortex into a dense tangle of electrical spaghetti.\nAnd there\u2019s a lot going on in that mash of spaghetti. Each neuron has synaptic connections to as many as 1,000\u2014sometimes as high as 10,000\u2014other neurons. With around 20 billion neurons in the cortex, that means there are over 20 trillion individual neural connections in the cortex (and as high as a quadrillion connections in the entire brain). In our cubic meter alone, there will be over 20 million synapses.\nTo further complicate things, not only are there many spaghetti strands coming out of each of the 40,000 marbles in our cube, but there are thousands of other spaghetti strings passing through our cube from other parts of the cortex. That means that if we were trying to record signals or stimulate neurons in this particular cubic area, we\u2019d have a lot of difficulty, because in the mess of spaghetti, it would be very hard to figure out which spaghetti strings belonged to our soma marbles (and god forbid there are Purkinje cells in the mix).\nAnd of course, there\u2019s the whole neuroplasticity thing. The voltages of each neuron would be constantly changing, as many as hundreds of times per second. And the tens of millions of synapse connections in our cube would be regularly changing sizes, disappearing, and reappearing.\nIf only that were the end of it.\nIt turns out there are other cells in the brain called glial cells\u2014cells that come in many different varieties and perform many different functions, like mopping up chemicals released into synapses, wrapping axons in myelin, and serving as the brain\u2019s immune system. Here are some common types of glial cell:28\n\nAnd how many glial cells are in the cortex? About the same number as there are neurons.20 So add about 40,000 of these wacky things into our cube.\nFinally, there are the blood vessels. In every cubic millimeter of cortex, there\u2019s a total of a meter of tiny blood vessels. On our scale, that means that in our cubic meter, there\u2019s a kilometer of blood vessels. Here\u2019s what the blood vessels in a space about that size look like:29\n\n\nThe Connectome Blue Box\nThere\u2019s an amazing project going on right now in the neuroscience world called the Human Connectome Project (pronounced \u201cconnec-tome\u201d) in which scientists are trying to create a complete detailed map of the entire human brain. Nothing close to this scale of brain mapping has ever been done.21\nThe project entails slicing a human brain into outrageously thin slices\u2014around 30-nanometer-thick slices. That\u2019s 1/33,000th of a millimeter (here\u2019s a machine slicing up a mouse brain).\nAnyway, in addition to producing some gorgeous images of the \u201cribbon\u201d formations axons with similar functions often form inside white matter, like\u2014\n\n\u2014the connectome project has helped people visualize just how packed the brain is with all this stuff. Here\u2019s a breakdown of all the different things going on in one tiny snippet of mouse brain (and this doesn\u2019t even include the blood vessels):30\n\n(In the image, E is the complete brain snippet, and F\u2013N show the separate components that make up E.)\n\nSo our meter box is a jam-packed, oozy, electrified mound of dense complexity\u2014now let\u2019s recall that in reality, everything in our box actually fits in a cubic millimeter.\nAnd the brain-machine interface engineers need to figure out what the microscopic somas buried in that millimeter are saying, and other times, to stimulate just the right somas to get them to do what the engineers want. Good luck with that.\nWe\u2019d have a super hard time doing that on our 1,000X brain. Our 1,000X brain that also happens to be a nice flat napkin. That\u2019s not how it normally works\u2014usually, the napkin is up on top of our Madison Square Garden brain and full of deep folds (on our scale, between five and 30 meters deep). In fact, less than a third of the cortex napkin is up on the surface of the brain\u2014most is buried inside the folds.\nAlso, engineers are not operating on a bunch of brains in a lab. The brain is covered with all those Russian doll layers, including the skull\u2014which at 1,000X would be around seven meters thick. And since most people don\u2019t really want you opening up their skull for very long\u2014and ideally not at all\u2014you have to try to work with those tiny marbles as non-invasively as possible.\nAnd this is all assuming you\u2019re dealing with the cortex\u2014but a lot of cool BMI ideas deal with the structures down below, which if you\u2019re standing on top of our MSG brain, are buried 50 or 100 meters under the surface.\nThe 1,000X game also hammers home the sheer scope of the brain. Think about how much was going on in our cube\u2014and now remember that that\u2019s only one 500,000th of the cortex. If we broke our whole giant cortex into similar meter cubes and lined them up, they\u2019d stretch 500km / 310mi\u2014all the way to Boston and beyond. And if you made the trek\u2014which would take over 100 hours of brisk walking\u2014at any point you could pause and look at the cube you happened to be passing by and it would have all of this complexity inside of it. All of this is currently in your brain.\nPart 3A: How Happy Are You That This Isn\u2019t Your Problem\nTotes.\nBack to Part 3: Brain-Machine Interfaces\nSo how do scientists and engineers begin to manage this situation?\nWell they do the best they can with the tools they currently have\u2014tools used to record or stimulate neurons (we\u2019ll focus on the recording side for the time being). Let\u2019s take a look at the options:\nBMI Tools\nWith the current work that\u2019s being done, three broad criteria seem to stand out when evaluating a type of recording tool\u2019s pros and cons:\n1) Scale \u2013 how many neurons can be simultaneously recorded\n2) Resolution \u2013 how detailed is the information the tool receives\u2014there are two types of resolution, spatial (how closely your recordings come to telling you how individual neurons are firing) and temporal (how well you can determine when the activity you record happened)\n3) Invasiveness \u2013 is surgery needed, and if so, how extensively\nThe long-term goal is to have all three of your cakes and eat them all. But for now, it\u2019s always a question of \u201cwhich one (or two) of these criteria are you willing to completely fail?\u201d Going from one tool to another isn\u2019t an overall upgrade or downgrade\u2014it\u2019s a tradeoff.\nLet\u2019s examine the types of tools currently being used:\nfMRI\nScale: high (it shows you information across the whole brain)\nResolution: medium-low spatial, very low temporal\nInvasiveness: non-invasive\nfMRI isn\u2019t typically used for BMIs, but it is a classic recording tool\u2014it gives you information about what\u2019s going on inside the brain.\nfMRI uses MRI\u2014magnetic resonance imaging\u2014technology. MRIs, invented in the 1970s, were an evolution of the x-ray-based CAT scan. Instead of using x-rays, MRIs use magnetic fields (along with radio waves and other signals) to generate images of the body and brain. Like this:31\n\nAnd this full set of cross sections, allowing you to see through an entire head.\n\nPretty amazing technology.\nfMRI (\u201cfunctional\u201d MRI) uses similar technology to track changes in blood flow. Why? Because when areas of the brain become more active, they use more energy, so they need more oxygen\u2014so blood flow increases to the area to deliver that oxygen. Blood flow indirectly indicates where activity is happening. Here\u2019s what an fMRI scan might show:32\n\nOf course, there\u2019s always blood throughout the brain\u2014what this image shows is where blood flow has increased (red/orange/yellow) and where it has decreased (blue). And because fMRI can scan through the whole brain, results are 3-dimensional:\n\nfMRI has many medical uses, like informing doctors whether or not certain parts of the brain are functioning properly after a stroke, and fMRI has taught neuroscientists a ton about which regions of the brain are involved with which functions. Scans also have the benefit of providing info about what\u2019s going on in the whole brain at any given time, and it\u2019s safe and totally non-invasive.\nThe big drawback is resolution. fMRI scans have a literal resolution, like a computer screen has with pixels, except the pixels are three-dimensional, cubic volume pixels\u2014or \u201cvoxels.\u201d\nfMRI voxels have gotten smaller as the technology has improved, bringing the spatial resolution up. Today\u2019s fMRI voxels can be as small as a cubic millimeter. The brain has a volume of about 1,200,000mm3, so a high-resolution fMRI scan divides the brain into about one million little cubes. The problem is that on neuron scale, that\u2019s still pretty huge (the same size as our scaled-up cubic meter above)\u2014each voxel contains tens of thousands of neurons. So what the fMRI is showing you, at best, is the average blood flow drawn in by each group of 40,000 or so neurons.\nThe even bigger problem is temporal resolution. fMRI tracks blood flow, which is both imprecise and comes with a delay of about a second\u2014an eternity in the world of neurons.\nEEG\nScale: high\nResolution: very low spatial, medium-high temporal\nInvasiveness: non-invasive\nDating back almost a century, EEG (electroencephalography) puts an array of electrodes on your head. You know, this whole thing:33\n\nEEG is definitely technology that will look hilariously primitive to a 2050 person, but for now, it\u2019s one of the only tools that can be used with BMIs that\u2019s totally non-invasive. EEGs record electrical activity in different regions of the brain, displaying the findings like this:34\n\nEEG graphs can uncover information about medical issues like epilepsy, track sleep patterns, or be used to determine something like the status of a dose of anesthesia.\nAnd unlike fMRI, EEG has pretty good temporal resolution, getting electrical signals from the brain right as they happen\u2014though the skull blurs the temporal accuracy considerably (bone is a bad conductor).\nThe major drawback is spatial resolution. EEG has none. Each electrode only records a broad average\u2014a vector sum of the charges from millions or billions of neurons (and a blurred one because of the skull).\nImagine that the brain is a baseball stadium, its neurons are the members of the crowd, and the information we want is, instead of electrical activity, vocal cord activity. In that case, EEG would be like a group of microphones placed outside the stadium, against the stadium\u2019s outer walls. You\u2019d be able to hear when the crowd was cheering and maybe predict the type of thing they were cheering about. You\u2019d be able to hear telltale signs that it was between innings and maybe whether or not it was a close game. You could probably detect when something abnormal happened. But that\u2019s about it.\nECoG\nScale: high\nResolution: low spatial, high temporal\nInvasiveness: kind of invasive\nECoG (electrocorticography) is a similar idea to EEG, also using surface electrodes\u2014except they put them under the skull, on the surface of the brain.35\n\nIck. But effective\u2014at least much more effective than EEG. Without the interference of the skull blurring things, ECoG picks up both higher spatial (about 1cm) and temporal resolution (5 milliseconds). ECoG electrodes can either be placed above or below the dura:36\n\nBringing back our stadium analogy, ECoG microphones are inside the stadium and a bit closer to the crowd. So the sound is much crisper than what EEG mics get from outside the stadium, and ECoG mics can better distinguish the sounds of individual sections of the crowd. But the improvement comes at a cost\u2014it requires invasive surgery. In the scheme of invasive surgeries, though, it\u2019s not so bad. As one neurosurgeon described to me, \u201cYou can slide stuff underneath the dura relatively non-invasively. You still have to make a hole in the head, but it\u2019s relatively non-invasive.\u201d\nLocal Field Potential\nScale: low\nResolution: medium-low spatial, high temporal\nInvasiveness: very invasive\nOkay here\u2019s where we shift from surface electrode discs to microelectrodes\u2014tiny needles surgeons stick into the brain.\nBrain surgeon Ben Rapoport described to me how his father (a neurologist) used to make microelectrodes:\nWhen my father was making electrodes, he\u2019d make them by hand. He\u2019d take a very fine wire\u2014like a gold or platinum or iridium wire, that was 10-30 microns in diameter, and he\u2019d insert that wire in a glass capillary tube that was maybe a millimeter in diameter. Then they\u2019d take that piece of glass over a flame and rotate it until the glass became soft. They\u2019d stretch out the capillary tube until it\u2019s incredibly thin, and then take it out of the flame and break it. Now the capillary tube is flush with and pinching the wire. The glass is an insulator and the wire is a conductor. So what you end up with is a glass-insulated stiff electrode that is maybe a few 10s of microns at the tip.\nToday, while some electrodes are still made by hand, newer techniques use silicon wafers and manufacturing technology borrowed from the integrated circuits industry.\nThe way local field potentials (LFP) work is simple\u2014you take one of these super thin needles with an electrode tip and stick it one or two millimeters into the cortex. There it picks up the average of the electrical charges from all of the neurons within a certain radius of the electrode.\nLFP gives you the not-that-bad spatial resolution of the fMRI combined with the instant temporal resolution of an ECoG. Kind of the best of all the worlds described above when it comes to resolution.\nUnfortunately, it does badly on both other criteria.\nUnlike fMRI, EEG, and ECoG, microelectrode LFP does not have scale\u2014it only tells you what the little sphere surrounding it is doing. And it\u2019s far more invasive, actually entering the brain.\nIn the baseball stadium, LFP is a single microphone hanging over a single section of seats, picking up a crisp feed of the sounds in that area, and maybe picking out an individual voice for a second here and there\u2014but otherwise only getting the general vibe.\nA more recent development is the multielectrode array, which is the same idea as the LFP except it\u2019s about 100 LFPs all at once, in a single area of the cortex. A multielectrode array looks like this:37\n\nA tiny 4mm x 4mm square with 100 tiny silicon electrodes on it. Here\u2019s another image where you can see just how sharp the electrodes are\u2014just a few microns across at the very tip:38\n\nSingle-Unit Recording\nScale: tiny\nResolution: super high\nInvasiveness: very invasive\nTo record a broader LFP, the electrode tip is a bit rounded to give the electrode more surface area, and they turn the resistance down with the intent of allowing very faint signals from a wide range of locations to be picked up. The end result is the electrode picks up a chorus of activity from the local field.\nSingle-unit recording also uses a needle electrode, but they make the tip super sharp and crank up the resistance. This wipes out most of the noise and leaves the electrode picking up almost nothing\u2014until it finds itself so close to a neuron (maybe 50\u00b5m away) that the signal from that neuron is strong enough to make it past the electrode\u2019s high resistance wall. With distinct signals from one neuron and no background noise, this electrode can now voyeur in on the private life of a single neuron. Lowest possible scale, highest possible resolution.\nBy the way, you can listen to a neuron fire here (what you\u2019re actually hearing is the electro-chemical firing of a neuron, converted to audio).\nSome electrodes want to take the relationship to the next level and will go for a technique called the patch clamp, whereby it\u2019ll get rid of its electrode tip, leaving just a tiny little tube called a glass pipette,22 and it\u2019ll actually directly assault a neuron by sucking a \u201cpatch\u201d of its membrane into the tube, allowing for even finer measurements:39\n\nA patch clamp also has the benefit that, unlike all the other methods we\u2019ve discussed, because it\u2019s physically touching the neuron, it can not only record but stimulate the neuron,23 injecting current or holding voltage at a set level to do specific tests (other methods can stimulate neurons, but only entire groups together).\nFinally, electrodes can fully defile the neuron and actually penetrate through the membrane, which is called sharp electrode recording. If the tip is sharp enough, this won\u2019t destroy the cell\u2014the membrane will actually seal around the electrode, making it very easy to stimulate the neuron or record the voltage difference between the inside and outside of the neuron. But this is a short-term technique\u2014a punctured neuron won\u2019t survive long.\nIn our stadium, a single unit recording is a one-directional microphone clipped to a single crowd member\u2019s collar. A patch clamp or sharp recording is a mic in someone\u2019s throat, registering the exact movement of their vocal cords. This is a great way to learn about that person\u2019s experience at the game, but it also gives you no context, and you can\u2019t really tell if the sounds and reactions of that person are representative of what\u2019s going on in the game.\nAnd that\u2019s about what we\u2019ve got, at least in common usage. These tools are simultaneously unbelievably advanced and what will seem like Stone Age technology to future humans, who won\u2019t believe you had to choose either high-res or a wide field and that you actually had to open someone\u2019s skull to get high-quality brain readouts or write-ins.\nBut given their limitations, these tools have taught us worlds about the brain and led to the creation of some amazing early BMIs. Here\u2019s what\u2019s already out there\u2014\nThe BMIs we already have\nIn 1969, a researcher named Eberhard Fetz connected a single neuron in a monkey\u2019s brain to a dial in front of the monkey\u2019s face. The dial would move when the neuron was fired. When the monkey would think in a way that fired the neuron and the dial would move, he\u2019d get a banana-flavored pellet. Over time, the monkey started getting better at the game because he wanted more delicious pellets. The monkey had learned to make the neuron fire and inadvertently became the subject of the first real brain-machine interface.\nProgress was slow over the next few decades, but by the mid-90s, things had started to move, and it\u2019s been quietly accelerating ever since.\nGiven that both our understanding of the brain and the electrode hardware we\u2019ve built are pretty primitive, our efforts have typically focused on building straightforward interfaces to be used with the areas of the brain we understand the best, like the motor cortex and the visual cortex.\nAnd given that human experimentation is only really possible for people who are trying to use BMIs to alleviate an impairment\u2014and because that\u2019s currently where the market demand is\u2014our efforts have focused so far almost entirely on restoring lost function to people with disabilities.\nThe major BMI industries of the future that will give all humans magical superpowers and transform the world are in their fetal stage right now\u2014and we should look at what\u2019s being worked on as a set of clues about what the mind-boggling worlds of 2040 and 2060 and 2100 might be like.\nLike, check this out:\n\nThat\u2019s a computer built by Alan Turing in 1950 called the Pilot ACE. Truly cutting edge in its time.\nNow check this out:\n\nAs you read through the examples below, I want you to think about this analogy\u2014\nPilot ACE is to iPhone 7 \nas \nEach BMI example below is to _____\n\u2014and try to imagine what the blank looks like. And we\u2019ll come back to the blank later in the post.\nAnyway, from everything I\u2019ve read about and discussed with people in the field, there seem to be three major categories of brain-machine interface being heavily worked on right now:\nEarly BMI type #1: Using the motor cortex as a remote control\nIn case you forgot this from 9,000 words ago, the motor cortex is this guy:\n\nAll areas of the brain confuse us, but the motor cortex confuses us less than almost all the other areas. And most importantly, it\u2019s well-mapped, meaning specific parts of it control specific parts of the body (remember the upsetting homunculus?).\nAlso importantly, it\u2019s one of the major areas of the brain in charge of our output. When a human does something, the motor cortex is almost always the one pulling the strings (at least for the physical part of the doing). So the human brain doesn\u2019t really have to learn to use the motor cortex as a remote control, because the brain already uses the motor cortex as its remote control.\nLift your hand up. Now put it down. See? Your hand is like a little toy drone, and your brain just picked up the motor cortex remote control and used it to make the drone fly up and then back down.\nThe goal of motor cortex-based BMIs is to tap into the motor cortex, and then when the remote control fires a command, to hear that command and then send it to some kind of machine that can respond to it the way, say, your hand would. A bundle of nerves is the middleman between your motor cortex and your hand. BMIs are the middleman between your motor cortex and a computer. Simple.\nOne barebones type of interface allows a human\u2014often a person paralyzed from the neck down or someone who has had a limb amputated\u2014to move a cursor on a screen with only their thoughts.\nThis begins with a 100-pin multielectrode array being implanted in the person\u2019s motor cortex. The motor cortex in a paralyzed person usually works just fine\u2014it\u2019s just that the spinal cord, which had served as the middleman between the cortex and the body, stopped doing its job. So with the electrode array implanted, researchers have the person try to move their arm in different directions. Even though they can\u2019t do that, the motor cortex still fires normally, as if they can.\nWhen someone moves their arm, their motor cortex bursts into a flurry of activity\u2014but each neuron is usually only interested in one type of movement. So one neuron might fire whenever the person moves their arm to the right\u2014but it\u2019s bored by other directions and is less active in those cases. That neuron alone, then, could tell a computer when the person wants to move their arm to the right and when they don\u2019t. But that\u2019s all. But with an electrode array, 100 single-unit electrodes each listen to a different neuron.24 So when they do testing, they\u2019ll ask the person to try to move their arm to the right, and maybe 38 of the 100 electrodes detect their neuron firing. When the person tries to go left with their arm, maybe 41 others fire. After going through a bunch of different movements and directions and speeds, a computer takes the data from the electrodes and synthesizes it into a general understanding of which firing patterns correspond to which movement intentions on an X-Y axis.\nThen when they link up that data to a computer screen, the person can use their mind, via \u201ctrying\u201d to move the cursor, to really control the cursor. And this actually works. Through the work of motor-cortex-BMI pioneer company BrainGate, here\u2019s a guy playing a video game using only his mind.\n\nAnd if 100 neurons can tell you where they want to move a cursor, why couldn\u2019t they tell you when they want to pick up a mug of coffee and take a sip? That\u2019s what this quadriplegic woman did:\n\nAnother quadriplegic woman flew an F-35 fighter jet in a simulation, and a monkey recently used his mind to ride around in a wheelchair.\nAnd why stop with arms? Brazilian BMI pioneer Miguel Nicolelis and his team built an entire exoskeleton that allowed a paralyzed man to make the opening kick of the World Cup.25\n\nThe Proprioception Blue Box\nMoving these kinds of \u201cneuroprosthetics\u201d is all about the recording of neurons, but for these devices to be truly effective, this needs to not be a one-way street, but a loop that includes recording and stimulation pathways. We don\u2019t really think about this, but a huge part of your ability to pick up an object is all of the incoming sensory information your hand\u2019s skin and muscles send back in (called \u201cproprioception\u201d). In one video I saw, a woman with numbed fingers tried to light a match, and it was almost impossible for her to do it, despite having no other disabilities. And the beginning of this video shows the physical struggles of a man with a perfectly functional motor cortex but impaired proprioception. So for something like a bionic arm to really feel like an arm, and to really be useful, it needs to be able to send sensory information back in.\nStimulating neurons is even harder than recording them. As researcher Flip Sabes explained to me:\nIf I record a pattern of activity, it doesn\u2019t mean I can readily recreate that pattern of activity by just playing it back. You can compare it to the planets in the Solar System. You can watch the planets move around and record their movements. But then if you jumble them all up and later want to recreate the original motion of one of the planets, you can\u2019t just take that one planet and put it back into its orbit, because it\u2019ll be influenced by all the other planets. Likewise, neurons aren\u2019t just working in isolation\u2014so there\u2019s a fundamental irreversibility there. On top of that, with all of the axons and dendrites, it\u2019s hard to just stimulate the neurons you want to\u2014because when you try, you\u2019ll hit a whole jumble of them.\nFlip\u2019s lab tries to deal with these challenges by getting the brain to help out. It turns out that if you reward a monkey with a succulent sip of orange juice when a single neuron fires, eventually the monkey will learn to make the neuron fire on demand. The neuron could then act as another kind of remote control. This means that normal motor cortex commands are only one possibility as a control mechanism. Likewise, until BMI technology gets good enough to perfect stimulation, you can use the brain\u2019s neuroplasticity as a shortcut. If it\u2019s too hard to make someone\u2019s bionic fingertip touch something and send back information that feels just like the kind of sensation their own fingertip used to give them, the arm could instead send some other signal into the brain. At first, this would seem odd to the patient\u2014but eventually the brain can learn to treat that signal as a new sense of touch. This concept is called \u201csensory substitution\u201d and makes the brain a collaborator in BMI efforts.\n\nIn these developments are the seeds of other future breakthrough technologies\u2014like brain-to-brain communication.\nNicolelis created an experiment where the motor cortex of one rat in Brazil was wired, via the internet, to the motor cortex of another rat in the US. The rat in Brazil was presented with two transparent boxes, each with a lever attached to it, and inside one of the boxes would be a treat. To attempt to get the treat, the rat would press the lever of the box that held the treat. Meanwhile, the rat in the US was in a similar cage with two similar boxes, except unlike the rat in Brazil, the boxes weren\u2019t transparent and offered him no information about which of his two levers would yield a treat and which wouldn\u2019t. The only info the US rat had were the signals his brain received from the Brazil rat\u2019s motor cortex. The Brazil rat had the key knowledge\u2014but the way the experiment worked, the rats only received treats when the US rat pressed the correct lever. If he pulled the wrong one, neither would. The amazing thing is that over time, the rats got better at this and began to work together, almost like a single nervous system\u2014even though neither had any idea the other rat existed. The US rat\u2019s success rate at choosing the correct lever with no information would have been 50%. With the signals coming from the Brazil rat\u2019s brain, the success rate jumped to 64%. (Here\u2019s a video of the rats doing their thing.)\nThis has even worked, crudely, in people. Two people, in separate buildings, worked together to play a video game. One could see the game, the other had the controller. Using simple EEG headsets, the player who could see the game would, without moving his hand, think about moving his hand to press the \u201cshoot\u201d button on a controller. Because their brains\u2019 devices were communicating with each other, the player with the controller would then feel a twitch in his finger and press the shoot button.\nEarly BMI type #2: Artificial ears and eyes\nThere are a couple reasons giving sound to the deaf and sight to the blind is among the more manageable BMI categories.\nThe first is that like the motor cortex, the sensory cortices are parts of the brain we tend to understand pretty well, partly because they too tend to be well-mapped.\nThe second is that in many early applications, we don\u2019t really need to deal with the brain\u2014we can just deal with the place where ears and eyes connect to the brain, since that\u2019s often where the impairment is based.\nAnd while the motor cortex stuff was mostly about recording neurons to get information out of the brain, artificial senses go the other way\u2014stimulation of neurons to send information in.\nOn the ears side of things, recent decades have seen the development of the groundbreaking cochlear implant.  \n\nThe How Hearing Works Blue Box\nWhen you think you\u2019re \u201chearing\u201d \u201csound,\u201d here\u2019s what\u2019s actually happening:\nWhat we think of as sound is actually patterns of vibrations in the air molecules around your head. When a guitar string or someone\u2019s vocal cords or the wind or anything else makes a sound, it\u2019s because it\u2019s vibrating, which pushes nearby air molecules into a similar vibration and that pattern expands outward in a sphere, kind of like the surface of water expands outward in a circular ripple when something touches it.26\nYour ear is a machine that converts those air vibrations into electrical impulses. Whenever air (or water, or any other medium whose molecules can vibrate) enters your ear, your ear translates the precise way it\u2019s vibrating into an electrical code that it sends into the nerve endings that touch it. This causes those nerves to fire a pattern of action potentials that send the code into your auditory cortex for processing. Your brain receives the information, and we call the experience of receiving that particular type of information \u201chearing.\u201d\nMost people who are deaf or hard of hearing don\u2019t have a nerve problem or an auditory cortex problem\u2014they usually have an ear problem. Their brain is as ready as anyone else\u2019s to turn electrical impulses into hearing\u2014it\u2019s just that their auditory cortex isn\u2019t receiving any electrical impulses in the first place, because the machine that converts air vibrations into those impulses isn\u2019t doing its job.\nThe ear has a lot of parts, but it\u2019s the cochlea in particular that makes the key conversion. When vibrations enter the fluid in the cochlea, it causes thousands of tiny hairs lining the cochlea to vibrate, and the cells those hairs are attached to transform the mechanical energy of the vibrations into electrical signals that then excite the auditory nerve. Here\u2019s what it all looks like:40\n\nThe cochlea also sorts the incoming sound by frequency. Here\u2019s a cool chart that shows why lower sounds are processed at the end of the cochlea and high sounds are processed at the beginning (and also why there\u2019s a minimum and maximum frequency on what the ear can hear):41\n\n\nA cochlear implant is a little computer that has a microphone coming out of one end (which sits on the ear) and a wire coming out of the other that connects to an array of electrodes that line the cochlea. \nSo sound comes into the microphone (the little hook on top of the ear), and goes into the brown thing, which processes the sound to filter out the less useful frequencies. Then the brown thing transmits the information through the skin, through electrical induction, to the computer\u2019s other component, which converts the info into electric impulses and sends them into the cochlea. The electrodes filter the impulses by frequency just like the cochlea and stimulate the auditory nerve just like the hairs on the cochlea do. This is what it looks like from the outside:\n\nIn other words, an artificial ear, performing the same sound-to-impulses-to-auditory-nerve function the ear does.\nCheck out what sound sounds like to someone with the implant.\nNot great. Why? Because to send sound into the brain with the richness the ear hears with, you\u2019d need 3,500 electrodes. Most cochlear implants have about 16.27 Crude.\nBut we\u2019re in the Pilot ACE era\u2014so of course it\u2019s crude.\nStill, today\u2019s cochlear implant allows deaf people to hear speech and have conversations, which is a groundbreaking development.28\nMany parents of deaf babies are now having a cochlear implant put in when the baby\u2019s about one year old. Like this baby, whose reaction to hearing for the first time is cute.\n\nThere\u2019s a similar revolution underway in the world of blindness, in the form of the retinal implant.\nBlindness is often the result of a retinal disease. When this is the case, a retinal implant can perform a similar function for sight as a cochlear implant does for hearing (though less directly). It performs the normal duties of the eye and hands things off to nerves in the form of electrical impulses, just like the eye does.\nA more complicated interface than the cochlear implant, the first retinal implant was approved by the FDA in 2011\u2014the Argus II implant, made by Second Sight. The retinal implant looks like this:42\n\nAnd it works like this:\n\nThe retinal implant has 60 sensors. The retina has around a million neurons. Crude. But seeing vague edges and shapes and patterns of light and dark sure beats seeing nothing at all. What\u2019s encouraging is that you don\u2019t need a million sensors to gain a reasonable amount of sight\u2014simulations suggest that 600-1,000 electrodes would be enough for reading and facial recognition.\nEarly BMI type #3: Deep brain stimulation\nDating back to the late 1980s, deep brain stimulation is yet another crude tool that is also still pretty life-changing for a lot of people.\nIt\u2019s also a type of category of BMI that doesn\u2019t involve communication with the outside world\u2014it\u2019s about using brain-machine interfaces to treat or enhance yourself by altering something internally.\nWhat happens here is one or two electrode wires, usually with four separate electrode sites, are inserted into the brain, often ending up somewhere in the limbic system. Then a little pacemaker computer is implanted in the upper chest and wired to the electrodes. Like this unpleasant man:43\n\nThe electrodes can then give a little zap when called for, which can do a variety of important things. Like:\n\nReduce the tremors of people with Parkinson\u2019s Disease\nReduce the severity of seizures\nChill people with OCD out\n\nIt\u2019s also experimentally (not yet FDA approved) been able to mitigate certain kinds of chronic pain like migraines or phantom limb pain, treat anxiety or depression or PTSD, or even be combined with muscle stimulation elsewhere in the body to restore and retrain circuits that were broken down from stroke or a neurological disease.\n___________\nThis is the state of the early BMI industry, and it\u2019s the moment when Elon Musk is stepping into it. For him, and for Neuralink, today\u2019s BMI industry is Point A. We\u2019ve spent the whole post so far in the past, building up to the present moment. Now it\u2019s time to step into the future\u2014to figure out what Point B is and how we\u2019re going to get there.\nPart 4: Neuralink\u2019s Challenge\n\nHaving already written about two of Elon Musk\u2019s companies\u2014Tesla and SpaceX\u2014I think I understand his formula. It looks like this:\n\nAnd his initial thinking about a new company always starts on the right and works its way left.\nHe decides that some specific change in the world will increase the likelihood of humanity having the best possible future. He knows that large-scale world change happens quickest when the whole world\u2014the Human Colossus\u2014is working on it. And he knows that the Human Colossus will work toward a goal if (and only if) there\u2019s an economic forcing function in place\u2014if it\u2019s a good business decision to spend resources innovating toward that goal.\nOften, before a booming industry starts booming, it\u2019s like a pile of logs\u2014it has all the ingredients of a fire and it\u2019s ready to go\u2014but there\u2019s no match. There\u2019s some technological shortcoming that\u2019s preventing the industry from taking off.\nSo when Elon builds a company, its core initial strategy is usually to create the match that will ignite the industry and get the Human Colossus working on the cause. This, in turn, Elon believes, will lead to developments that will change the world in the way that increases the likelihood of humanity having the best possible future. But you have to look at his companies from a zoomed-out perspective to see all of this. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll mistake what they do as their business for what they do\u2014when in fact, what they do as their business is usually a mechanism to sustain the company while it innovates to try to make that critical match.\nBack when I was working on the Tesla and SpaceX posts, I asked Elon why he went into engineering and not science, and he explained that when it comes to progress, \u201cengineering is the limiting factor.\u201d In other words, the progress of science, business, and industry are all at the whim of the progress of engineering. If you look at history, this makes sense\u2014behind each of the greatest revolutions in human progress is an engineering breakthrough. A match.\n\nSo to understand an Elon Musk company, you need to think about the match he\u2019s trying to create\u2014along with three other variables:\n\nI know what\u2019s in these boxes with the other companies:\n\nAnd when I started trying to figure out what Neuralink was all about, I knew those were the variables I needed to fill in. At the time, I had only had the chance to get a very vague idea of one of the variables\u2014that the goal of the company was \u201cto accelerate the advent of a whole-brain interface.\u201d Or what I\u2019ve come to think of as a wizard hat.\n\nAs I understood it, a whole-brain interface was what a brain-machine interface would be in an ideal world\u2014a super-advanced concept where essentially all the neurons in your brain are able to communicate seamlessly with the outside world. It was a concept loosely based on the science fiction idea of a \u201cneural lace,\u201d described in Iain Banks\u2019 Culture series\u2014a massless, volumeless, whole-brain interface that can be teleported into the brain.\nI had a lot of questions.\nLuckily, I was on my way to San Francisco, where I had plans to sit down with half of Neuralink\u2019s founding team and be the dumbest person in the room.\n\n\nThe I\u2019m Not Being Self-Deprecating I Really Was Definitely the Dumbest Person in the Room Just Look at This Shit Blue Box\nThe Neuralink team:\nPaul Merolla, who spent the last seven years as the lead chip designer at IBM on their SyNAPSE program, where he led the development of the TrueNorth chip\u2014one of the largest CMOS devices ever designed by transistor count nbd. Paul told me his field was called neuromorphic, where the goal is to design transistor circuits based on principles of brain architecture.\nVanessa Tolosa, Neuralink\u2019s microfabrication expert and one of the world\u2019s foremost researchers on biocompatible materials. Vanessa\u2019s work involves designing biocompatible materials based on principles from the integrated circuits industry.\nMax Hodak, who worked on the development of some groundbreaking BMI technology at Miguel Nicolelis\u2019s lab at Duke while also commuting across the country twice a week in college to run Transcriptic, the \u201crobotic cloud laboratory for the life sciences\u201d he founded.\nDJ Seo, who while at UC Berkeley in his mid-20s designed a cutting-edge new BMI concept called neural dust\u2014tiny ultrasound sensors that could provide a new way to record brain activity.\nTim Hanson, whom a colleague described as \u201cone of the best all-around engineers on the planet\u201d and who self-taught himself enough about materials science and microfabrication methods to develop some of the core technology that\u2019ll be used at Neuralink.\nFlip Sabes, a leading researcher whose lab at UCSF has pioneered new ground in BMIs by combining \u201ccortical physiology, computational and theoretical modeling, and human psychophysics and physiology.\u201d\nTim Gardner, a leading researcher at BU, whose lab works on implanting BMIs in birds, in order to study \u201chow complex songs are assembled from elementary neural units\u201d and learn about \u201cthe relationships between patterns of neural activity on different time-scales.\u201d Both Tim and Flip have left tenured positions to join the Neuralink team\u2014pretty good testament to the promise they believe this company has.\nAnd then there\u2019s Elon, both as their CEO/Founder and a fellow team member. Elon being CEO makes this different from other recent things he\u2019s started and puts Neuralink on the top tier for him, where only SpaceX and Tesla have lived. When it comes to neuroscience, Elon has the least technical knowledge on the team\u2014but he also started SpaceX without very much technical knowledge and quickly became a certifiable rocket science expert by reading and by asking questions of the experts on the team. That\u2019ll probably happen again here. (And for good reason\u2014he pointed out: \u201cWithout a strong technical understanding, I think it\u2019s hard to make the right decisions.\u201d)\n\nI asked Elon about how he brought this team together. He said that he met with literally over 1,000 people in order to assemble this group, and that part of the challenge was the large number of totally separate areas of expertise required when you\u2019re working on technology that involves neuroscience, brain surgery, microscopic electronics, clinical trials, etc. Because it was such a cross-disciplinary area, he looked for cross-disciplinary experts. And you can see that in those bios\u2014everyone brings their own unique crossover combination to a group that together has the rare ability to think as a single mega-expert. Elon also wanted to find people who were totally on board with the zoomed-out mission\u2014who were more focused on industrial results than producing white papers. Not an easy group to assemble.\nBut there they were, sitting around the table looking at me, as it hit me 40 seconds in that I should have done a lot more research before coming here.\n\nThey took the hint and dumbed it down about four notches, and as the discussion went on, I started to wrap my head around things. Throughout the next few weeks, I met with each of the remaining Neuralink team members as well, each time playing the role of the dumbest person in the room. In these meetings, I focused on trying to form a comprehensive picture of the challenges at hand and what the road to a wizard hat might look like. I really wanted to understand these two boxes:\n\nThe first one was easy. The business side of Neuralink is a brain-machine interface development company. They want to create cutting-edge BMIs\u2014what one of them referred to as \u201cmicron-sized devices.\u201d Doing this will support the growth of the company while also providing a perfect vehicle for putting their innovations into practice (the same way SpaceX uses their launches both to sustain the company and experiment with their newest engineering developments).\nAs for what kind of interface they\u2019re planning to work on first, here\u2019s what Elon said:\nWe are aiming to bring something to market that helps with certain severe brain injuries (stroke, cancer lesion, congenital) in about four years. \nThe second box was a lot hazier. It seems obvious to us today that using steam engine technology to harness the power of fire was the thing that had to happen to ignite the Industrial Revolution. But if you talked to someone in 1760 about it, they would have had a lot less clarity\u2014on exactly which hurdles they were trying to get past, what kinds of innovations would allow them to leap over those hurdles, or how long any of this would take. And that\u2019s where we are here\u2014trying to figure out what the match looks like that will ignite the neuro revolution and how to create it.\nThe starting place for a discussion about innovation is a discussion about hurdles\u2014what are you even trying to innovate past? In Neuralink\u2019s case, a whole lot of things. But given that, here too, engineering will likely prove to be the limiting factor, here are some seemingly large challenges that probably won\u2019t end up being the major roadblock:\nPublic skepticism \nPew recently conducted a survey asking Americans about which future biotechnologies give them the shits the most. It turns out BMIs worry Americans even more than gene editing:44\n\nFlip Sabes, one of Neuralink\u2019s ground floor members, doesn\u2019t get it.\nTo a scientist, to think about changing the fundamental nature of life\u2014creating viruses, eugenics, etc.\u2014it raises a specter that many biologists find quite worrisome, whereas the neuroscientists that I know, when they think about chips in the brain, it doesn\u2019t seem that foreign, because we already have chips in the brain. We have deep brain stimulation to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s Disease, we have early trials of chips to restore vision, we have the cochlear implant\u2014so to us it doesn\u2019t seem like that big of a stretch to put devices into a brain to read information out and to read information back in.\nAnd after learning all about chips in the brain, I agree\u2014and when Americans eventually learn about it, I think they\u2019ll change their minds.\nHistory supports this prediction. People were super timid about Lasik eye surgery when it first became a thing\u201420 years ago, 20,000 people a year had the procedure done. Then everyone got used to it and now 2,000,000 people a year get laser eye surgery. Similar story with pacemakers. And defibrillators. And organ transplants\u2014which people at first considered a freakish Frankenstein-esque concept. Brain implants will probably be the same story.\nOur non-understanding of the brain\nYou know, the whole \u201cif understanding the brain is a mile, we\u2019re currently three inches in\u201d thing. Flip weighed in on this topic too:\nIf it were a prerequisite to understand the brain in order to interact with the brain in a substantive way, we\u2019d have trouble. But it\u2019s possible to decode all of those things in the brain without truly understanding the dynamics of the computation in the brain. Being able to read it out is an engineering problem. Being able to understand its origin and the organization of the neurons in fine detail in a way that would satisfy a neuroscientist to the core\u2014that\u2019s a separate problem. And we don\u2019t need to solve all of those scientific problems in order to make progress.\nIf we can just use engineering to get neurons to talk to computers, we\u2019ll have done our job, and machine learning can do much of the rest. Which then, ironically, will teach us about the brain. As Flip points out:\nThe flip side of saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to understand the brain to make engineering progress,\u201d is that making engineering progress will almost certainly advance our scientific knowledge\u2014kind of like the way Alpha Go ended up teaching the world\u2019s best players better strategies for the game. Then this scientific progress can lead to more engineering progress. The engineering and the science are gonna ratchet each other up here.\nAngry giants\nTesla and SpaceX are both stepping on some very big toes (like the auto industry, the oil and gas industry, and the military-industrial complex). Big toes don\u2019t like being stepped on, so they\u2019ll usually do whatever they can to hinder the stepper\u2019s progress. Luckily, Neuralink doesn\u2019t really have this problem. There aren\u2019t any massive industries that Neuralink is disrupting (at least not in the foreseeable future\u2014an eventual neuro revolution would disrupt almost every industry).\nNeuralink\u2019s hurdles are technology hurdles\u2014and there are many. But two challenges stand out as the largest\u2014challenges that, if conquered, may be impactful enough to trigger all the other hurdles to fall and totally change the trajectory of our future.\nMajor Hurdle 1: Bandwidth\nThere have never been more than a couple hundred electrodes in a human brain at once. When it comes to vision, that equals a super low-res image. When it comes to motor, that limits the possibilities to simple commands with little control. When it comes to your thoughts, a few hundred electrodes won\u2019t be enough to communicate more than the simplest spelled-out message.\nWe need higher bandwidth if this is gonna become a big thing. Way higher bandwidth.\nThe Neuralink team threw out the number \u201cone million simultaneously recorded neurons\u201d when talking about an interface that could really change the world. I\u2019ve also heard 100,000 as a number that would allow for the creation of a wide range of incredibly useful BMIs with a variety of applications.\nEarly computers had a similar problem. Primitive transistors took up a lot of space and didn\u2019t scale easily. Then in 1959 came the integrated circuit\u2014the computer chip. Now there was a way to scale the number of transistors in a computer, and Moore\u2019s Law\u2014the concept that the number of transistors that can fit onto a computer chip doubles every 18 months\u2014was born.\nUntil the 90s, electrodes for BMIs were all made by hand. Then we started figuring out how to manufacture those little 100-electrode multielectrode arrays using conventional semiconductor technologies. Neurosurgeon Ben Rapoport believes that \u201cthe move from hand manufacturing to Utah Array electrodes was the first hint that BMIs were entering a realm where Moore\u2019s Law could become relevant.\u201d\nThis is everything for the industry\u2019s potential. Our maximum today is a couple hundred electrodes able to measure about 500 neurons at once\u2014which is either super far from a million or really close, depending on the kind of growth pattern we\u2019re in. If we add 500 more neurons to our maximum every 18 months, we\u2019ll get to a million in the year 5017. If we double our total every 18 months, like we do with computer transistors, we\u2019ll get to a million in the year 2034.\nCurrently, we seem to be somewhere in between. Ian Stevenson and Konrad Kording published a paper that looked at the maximum number of neurons that could be simultaneously recorded at various points throughout the last 50 years (in any animal), and put the results on this graph:45\n\nSometimes called Stevenson\u2019s Law, this research suggests that the number of neurons we can simultaneously record seems to consistently double every 7.4 years. If that rate continues, it\u2019ll take us till the end of this century to reach a million, and until 2225 to record every neuron in the brain and get our totally complete wizard hat.\nWhatever the equivalent of the integrated circuit is for BMIs isn\u2019t here yet, because 7.4 years is too big a number to start a revolution. The breakthrough here isn\u2019t the device that can record a million neurons\u2014it\u2019s the paradigm shift that makes the future of that graph look more like Moore\u2019s Law and less like Stevenson\u2019s Law. Once that happens, a million neurons will follow.\nMajor Hurdle 2: Implantation\nBMIs won\u2019t sweep the world as long as you need to go in for skull-opening surgery to get involved.\nThis is a major topic at Neuralink. I think the word \u201cnon-invasive\u201d or \u201cnon-invasively\u201d came out of someone\u2019s mouth like 42 times in my discussions with the team.\nOn top of being both a major barrier to entry and a major safety issue, invasive brain surgery is expensive and in limited supply. Elon talked about an eventual BMI implantation process that could be automated: \u201cThe machine to accomplish this would need to be something like Lasik, an automated process\u2014because otherwise you just get constrained by the limited number of neural surgeons, and the costs are very high. You\u2019d need a Lasik-like machine ultimately to be able to do this at scale.\u201d\nMaking BMIs high-bandwidth alone would be a huge deal, as would developing a way to non-invasively implant devices. But doing both would start a revolution.\nOther hurdles\nToday\u2019s BMI patients have a wire coming out of their head. In the future, that certainly won\u2019t fly. Neuralink plans to work on devices that will be wireless. But that brings a lot of new challenges with it. You\u2019ll now need your device to be able to send and receive a lot of data wirelessly. Which means the implant also has to take care of things like signal amplification, analog-to-digital conversion, and data compression on its own. Oh and it needs to be powered inductively.\nAnother big one\u2014biocompatibility. Delicate electronics tend to not do well inside a jello ball. And the human body tends to not like having foreign objects in it. But the brain interfaces of the future are intended to last forever without any problems. This means that the device will likely need to be hermetically sealed and robust enough to survive decades of the oozing and shifting of the neurons around it. And the brain\u2014which treats today\u2019s devices like invaders and eventually covers them in scar tissue\u2014will need to somehow be tricked into thinking the device is just a normal brain part doing its thing.29\nThen there\u2019s the space issue. Where exactly are you gonna put your device that can interface with a million neurons in a skull that\u2019s already dealing with making space for 100 billion neurons? A million electrodes using today\u2019s multielectrode arrays would be the size of a baseball. So further miniaturization is another dramatic innovation to add to the list.\nThere\u2019s also the fact that today\u2019s electrodes are mostly optimized for simple electrical recording or simple electrical stimulation. If we really want an effective brain interface, we\u2019ll need something other than single-function, stiff electrodes\u2014something with the mechanical complexity of neural circuits, that can both record and stimulate, and that can interact with neurons chemically and mechanically as well as electrically.\nAnd just say all of this comes together perfectly\u2014a high-bandwidth, long-lasting, biocompatible, bidirectional communicative, non-invasively-implanted device. Now we can speak back and forth with a million neurons at once! Except this little thing where we actually don\u2019t know how to talk to neurons. It\u2019s complicated enough to decode the static-like firings of 100 neurons, but all we\u2019re really doing is learning what a set of specific firings corresponds to and matching them up to simple commands. That won\u2019t work with millions of signals. It\u2019s like how Google Translate essentially uses two dictionaries to swap words from one dictionary to another\u2014which is very different than understanding language. We\u2019ll need a pretty big leap in machine learning before a computer will be able to actually know a language, and we\u2019ll need just as big a leap for machines to understand the language of the brain\u2014because humans certainly won\u2019t be learning to decipher the code of millions of simultaneously chattering neurons.\nHow easy does colonizing Mars seem right now.\nBut I bet the telephone and the car and the moon landing would have seemed like insurmountable technological challenges to people a few decades earlier. Just like I bet this\u2014\n\n\u2014would have seemed utterly inconceivable to people at the time of this:\n\nAnd yet, there it is in your pocket. If there\u2019s one thing we should learn from the past, it\u2019s that there will always be ubiquitous technology of the future that\u2019s inconceivable to people of the past. We don\u2019t know which technologies that seem positively impossible to us will turn out to be ubiquitous later in our lives\u2014but there will be some. People always underestimate the Human Colossus.\nIf everyone you know in 40 years has electronics in their skull, it\u2019ll be because a paradigm shift took place that caused a fundamental shift in this industry. That shift is what the Neuralink team will try to figure out. Other teams are working on it too, and some cool ideas are being developed:\nCurrent BMI innovations\nA team at the University of Illinois is developing an interface made of silk:46\n\nSilk can be rolled up into a thin bundle and inserted into the brain relatively non-invasively. There, it would theoretically spread out around the brain and melt into the contours like shrink wrap. On the silk would be flexible silicon transistor arrays.\nIn his TEDx Talk, Hong Yeo demonstrated an electrode array printed on his skin, like a temporary tattoo, and researchers say this kind of technique could potentially be used on the brain:47\n\nAnother group is working on a kind of nano-scale, electrode-lined neural mesh so tiny it can be injected into the brain with a syringe:48\n\nFor scale\u2014that red tube on the right is the tip of a syringe. Nature Magazine has a nice graphic illustrating the concept:\n\nOther non-invasive techniques involve going in through veins and arteries. Elon mentioned this: \u201cThe least invasive way would be something that comes in like a heart stent like through a femoral artery and ultimately unfolds in the vascular system to interface with the neurons. Neurons use a lot of energy, so there\u2019s basically a road network to every neuron.\u201d\nDARPA, the technology innovation arm of the US military,30 through their recently funded BRAIN program, is working on tiny, \u201cclosed-loop\u201d neural implants that could replace medication.49\n\nA second DARPA project aims to fit a million electrodes into a device the size of two nickels stacked.\nAnother idea being worked on is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), in which a magnetic coil outside the head can create electrical pulses inside the brain.50\n\nThe pulses can stimulate targeted neuron areas, providing a type of deep brain stimulation that\u2019s totally non-invasive.\nOne of Neuralink\u2019s ground floor members, DJ Seo, led an effort to design an even cooler interface called \u201cneural dust.\u201d Neural dust refers to tiny, 100\u00b5m silicon sensors (about the same as the width of a hair) that would be sprinkled through the cortex. Right nearby, above the pia, would be a 3mm-sized device that could communicate with the dust sensors via ultrasound.\nThis is another example of the innovation benefits that come from an interdisciplinary team. DJ explained to me that \u201cthere are technologies that are not really thought about in this domain, but we can bring in some principles of their work.\u201d He says that neural dust is inspired both by microchip technology and RFID (the thing that allows hotel key cards to communicate with the door lock without making physical contact) principles. And you can easily see the multi-field influence in how it works:51\n\nOthers are working on even more out-there ideas, like optogenetics (where you inject a virus that attaches to a brain cell, causing it to thereafter be stimulated by light) or even using carbon nanotubes\u2014a million of which could be bundled together and sent to the brain via the bloodstream.\nThese people are all working on this arrow:\n\nIt\u2019s a relatively small group right now, but when the breakthrough spark happens, that\u2019ll quickly change. Developments will begin to happen rapidly. Brain interface bandwidth will get better and better as the procedures to implant them become simpler and cheaper. Public interest will pick up. And when public interest picks up, the Human Colossus notices an opportunity\u2014and then the rate of development skyrockets. Just like the breakthroughs in computer hardware caused the software industry to explode, major industries will pop up working on cutting-edge machines and intelligent apps to be used in conjunction with brain interfaces, and you\u2019ll tell some little kid in 2052 all about how when you grew up, no one could do any of the things she can do with her brain, and she\u2019ll be bored.\nI tried to get the Neuralink team to talk about 2052 with me. I wanted to know what life was going to be like once this all became a thing. I wanted to know what went in the [Pilot ACE : iPhone 7 :: Early BMIs : ____] blank. But it wasn\u2019t easy\u2014this was a team built specifically because of their focus on concrete results, not hype, and I was doing the equivalent of talking to people in the late 1700s who were feverishly trying to create a breakthrough steam engine and prodding them about when they thought there would be airplanes.\nBut I\u2019d keep pulling teeth until they\u2019d finally talk about their thoughts on the far future to get my hand off their tooth. I also focused a large portion of my talks with Elon on the far future possibilities and had other helpful discussions with Moran Cerf, a neuroscientist friend of mine who works on BMIs and thinks a lot about the long-term outlook. Finally, one reluctant-to-talk-about-his-predictions Neuralink team member told me that of course, he and his colleagues were dreamers\u2014otherwise they wouldn\u2019t be doing what they\u2019re doing\u2014and that many of them were inspired to get into this industry by science fiction. He recommended I talk to Ramez Naam, writer of the popular Nexus Trilogy, a series all about the future of BMIs, and also someone with a hard tech background that includes 19 software-related patents. So I had a chat with Ramez to round out the picture and ask him the 435 remaining questions I had about everything.\nAnd I came out of all of it utterly blown away. I wrote once about how I think if you went back to 1750\u2014a time when there was no electricity or motorized vehicles or telecommunication\u2014and retrieved, say, George Washington, and brought him to today and showed him our world, he\u2019d be so shocked by everything that he\u2019d die. You\u2019d have killed George Washington and messed everything up. Which got me thinking about the concept of how many years one would need to go into the future such that the ensuing shock from the level of progress would kill you. I called it a Die Progress Unit, or DPU.\nEver since the Human Colossus was born, our world has had a weird property to it\u2014it gets more magical as time goes on. That\u2019s why DPUs are a thing. And because advancement begets more rapid advancement, the trend is that as time passes, the DPUs get shorter. For George Washington, a DPU was a couple hundred years, which is outrageously short in the scheme of human history. But we now live in a time where things are moving so fast that we might experience one or even multiple DPUs in our lifetime. The amount that changed between 1750 and 2017 might happen again between now and another time when you\u2019re still alive. This is a ridiculous time to be alive\u2014it\u2019s just hard for us to notice because we live life so zoomed in.\nAnyway, I think about DPUs a lot and I always wonder what it would feel like to go forward in a time machine and experience what George would experience coming here. What kind of future could blow my mind so hard that it would kill me? We can talk about things like AI and gene editing\u2014and I have no doubt that progress in those areas could make me die of shock\u2014but it\u2019s always, \u201cWho knows what it\u2019ll be like!\u201d Never a descriptive picture.\nI think I might finally have a descriptive picture of a piece of our shocking future. Let me paint it for you.\nPart 5: The Wizard Era\n\nThe budding industry of brain-machine interfaces is the seed of a revolution that will change just about everything. But in many ways, the brain-interface future isn\u2019t really a new thing that\u2019s happening. If you take a step back, it looks more like the next big chapter in a trend that\u2019s been going on for a long time. Language took forever to turn into writing, which then took forever to turn into printing, and that\u2019s where things were when George Washington was around. Then came electricity and the pace picked up. Telephone. Radio. Television. Computers. And just like that, everyone\u2019s homes became magical. Then phones became cordless. Then mobile. Computers went from being devices for work and games to windows into a digital world we all became a part of. Then phones and computers merged into an everything device that brought the magic out of our homes and put it into our hands. And on our wrists. We\u2019re now in the early stages of a virtual and augmented reality revolution that will wrap the magic around our eyes and ears and bring our whole being into the digital world.\nYou don\u2019t need to be a futurist to see where this is going.\nMagic has worked its way from industrial facilities to our homes to our hands and soon it\u2019ll be around our heads. And then it\u2019ll take the next natural step. The magic is heading into our brains.\nIt will happen by way of a \u201cwhole-brain interface,\u201d or what I\u2019ve been calling a wizard hat\u2014a brain interface so complete, so smooth, so biocompatible, and so high-bandwidth that it feels as much a part of you as your cortex and limbic system. A whole-brain interface would give your brain the ability to communicate wirelessly with the cloud, with computers, and with the brains of anyone with a similar interface in their head. This flow of information between your brain and the outside world would be so effortless, it would feel similar to the thinking that goes on in your head today. And though we\u2019ve used the term brain-machine interface so far, I kind of think of a BMI as a specific brain interface to be used for a specific purpose, and the term doesn\u2019t quite capture the everything-of-everything concept of the whole-brain interface. So I\u2019ll call that a wizard hat instead.\nNow, to fully absorb the implications of having a wizard hat installed in your head and what that would change about you, you\u2019ll need to wrap your head around (no pun intended) two things:\n1) The intensely mind-bending idea\n2) The super ridiculously intensely mind-bending idea\nWe\u2019ll tackle #1 in this section and save #2 for the last section after you\u2019ve had time to absorb #1.\nElon calls the whole-brain interface and its many capabilities a \u201cdigital tertiary layer,\u201d a term that has two levels of meaning that correspond to our two mind-bending ideas above.\nThe first meaning gets at the idea of physical brain parts. We discussed three layers of brain parts\u2014the brain stem (run by the frog), the limbic system (run by the monkey), and the cortex (run by the rational thinker). We were being thorough, but for the rest of this post, we\u2019re going to leave the frog out of the discussion, since he\u2019s entirely functional and lives mostly behind the scenes.\nWhen Elon refers to a \u201cdigital tertiary layer,\u201d he\u2019s considering our existing brain having two layers\u2014our animal limbic system (which could be called our primary layer) and our advanced cortex (which could be called our secondary layer). The wizard hat interface, then, would be our tertiary layer\u2014a new physical brain part to complement the other two.\nIf thinking about this concept is giving you the willies, Elon has news for you:\nWe already have a digital tertiary layer in a sense, in that you have your computer or your phone or your applications. You can ask a question via Google and get an answer instantly. You can access any book or any music. With a spreadsheet, you can do incredible calculations. If you had an Empire State building filled with people\u2014even if they had calculators, let alone if they had to do it with a pencil and paper\u2014one person with a laptop could outdo the Empire State Building filled with people with calculators. You can video chat with someone in freaking Timbuktu for free. This would\u2019ve gotten you burnt for witchcraft in the old days. You can record as much video with sound as you want, take a zillion pictures, have them tagged with who they are and when it took place. You can broadcast communications through social media to millions of people simultaneously for free. These are incredible superpowers that the President of the United States didn\u2019t have twenty years ago.\nThe thing that people, I think, don\u2019t appreciate right now is that they are already a cyborg. You\u2019re already a different creature than you would have been twenty years ago, or even ten years ago. You\u2019re already a different creature. You can see this when they do surveys of like, \u201chow long do you want to be away from your phone?\u201d and\u2014particularly if you\u2019re a teenager or in your 20s\u2014even a day hurts. If you leave your phone behind, it\u2019s like missing limb syndrome. I think people\u2014they\u2019re already kind of merged with their phone and their laptop and their applications and everything.\nThis is a hard point to really absorb, because we don\u2019t feel like cyborgs. We feel like humans who use devices to do things. But think about your digital self\u2014you when you\u2019re interacting with someone on the internet or over FaceTime or when you\u2019re in a YouTube video. Digital you is fully you\u2014as much as in-person you is you\u2014right? The only difference is that you\u2019re not there in person\u2014you\u2019re using magic powers to send yourself to somewhere far away, at light speed, through wires and satellites and electromagnetic waves. The difference is the medium.\nBefore language, there wasn\u2019t a good way to get a thought from your brain into my brain. Then early humans invented the technology of language, transforming vocal cords and ears into the world\u2019s first communication devices and air as the first communication medium. We use these devices every time we talk to each other in person. It goes:\n\nThen we built upon that with another leap, inventing a second layer of devices, with its own medium, allowing us to talk long distance:\n\nOr maybe:\n\nIn that sense, your phone is as much \u201cyou\u201d as your vocal cords or your ears or your eyes. All of these things are simply tools to move thoughts from brain to brain\u2014so who cares if the tool is held in your hand, your throat, or your eye sockets? The digital age has made us a dual entity\u2014a physical creature who interacts with its physical environment using its biological parts and a digital creature whose digital devices\u2014whose digital parts\u2014allow it to interact with the digital world.\nBut because we don\u2019t think of it like that, we\u2019d consider someone with a phone in their head or throat a cyborg and someone else with a phone in their hand, pressed up against their head, not a cyborg. Elon\u2019s point is that the thing that makes a cyborg a cyborg is their capabilities\u2014not from which side of the skull those capabilities are generated.\nWe\u2019re already a cyborg, we already have superpowers, and we already spend a huge part of our lives in the digital world. And when you think of it like that, you realize how obvious it is to want to upgrade the medium that connects us to that world. This is the change Elon believes is actually happening when the magic goes into our brains:\nYou\u2019re already digitally superhuman. The thing that would change is the interface\u2014having a high-bandwidth interface to your digital enhancements. The thing is that today, the interface all necks down to this tiny straw, which is, particularly in terms of output, it\u2019s like poking things with your meat sticks, or using words\u2014either speaking or tapping things with fingers. And in fact, output has gone backwards. It used to be, in your most frequent form, output would be ten-finger typing. Now, it\u2019s like, two-thumb typing. That\u2019s crazy slow communication. We should be able to improve that by many orders of magnitude with a direct neural interface.\nIn other words, putting our technology into our brains isn\u2019t about whether it\u2019s good or bad to become cyborgs. It\u2019s that we are cyborgs and we will continue to be cyborgs\u2014so it probably makes sense to upgrade ourselves from primitive, low-bandwidth cyborgs to modern, high-bandwidth cyborgs.\nA whole-brain interface is that upgrade. It changes us from creatures whose primary and secondary layers live inside their heads and whose tertiary layer lives in their pocket, in their hand, or on their desk\u2014\n\n\u2014to creatures whose three layers all live together.\n\nYour life is full of devices, including the one you\u2019re currently using to read this. A wizard hat makes your brain into the device, allowing your thoughts to go straight from your head into the digital world.\nWhich doesn\u2019t only revolutionize human-computer communication.\nRight now humans communicate with each other like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s how it\u2019s been ever since we could communicate. But in a wizard hat world, it would look more like this:\n\n\n\nElon always emphasizes bandwidth when he talks about Neuralink\u2019s wizard hat goals. Interface bandwidth allows incoming images to be HD, incoming sound to be hi-fi, and motor movement commands to be tightly controlled\u2014but it\u2019s also a huge factor in communication. If information were a milkshake, bandwidth would be the width of the straw. Today, the bandwidth-of-communication graph looks something like this:\n\nSo computers can suck up the milkshake through a giant pipe, a human thinking would be using a large, pleasant-to-use straw, while language would be a frustratingly tiny coffee stirrer straw and typing (let alone texting) would be like trying to drink a milkshake through a syringe needle\u2014you might be able to get a drop out once a minute.\nMoran Cerf has gathered data on the actual bandwidth of different parts of the nervous system and on this graph, he compares them to equivalent bandwidths in the computer world:\n\nYou can see here on Moran\u2019s graph that the disparity in bandwidth between the ways we communicate and our thinking (which is at 30 bits/second on this graph) is even starker than my graph above depicts.\nBut making our brains the device cuts out those tiny straws, turning all of these:\n\nTo this:\n\nWhich preserves all the meaning with none of the fuss\u2014and changes the graph to this:\n\nWe\u2019d still be using straws, but far bigger, more effective ones.\nBut it\u2019s not just about the speed of communication. As Elon points out, it\u2019s about the nuance and accuracy of communication as well:\nThere are a bunch of concepts in your head that then your brain has to try to compress into this incredibly low data rate called speech or typing. That\u2019s what language is\u2014your brain has executed a compression algorithm on thought, on concept transfer. And then it\u2019s got to listen as well, and decompress what\u2019s coming at it. And this is very lossy as well. So, then when you\u2019re doing the decompression on those, trying to understand, you\u2019re simultaneously trying to model the other person\u2019s mind state to understand where they\u2019re coming from, to recombine in your head what concepts they have in their head that they\u2019re trying to communicate to you. \u2026 If you have two brain interfaces, you could actually do an uncompressed direct conceptual communication with another person.\nThis makes sense\u2014nuance is like a high-resolution thought, which makes the file simply too big to transfer quickly through a coffee straw. The coffee straw gives you two bad options when it comes to nuance: take a lot of time saying a lot of words to really depict the nuanced thought or imagery you want to convey to me, or save time by using succinct language\u2014but inevitably fail to transfer over the nuance. Compounding the effect is the fact that language itself is a low-resolution medium. A word is simply an approximation of a thought\u2014buckets that a whole category of similar-but-distinct thoughts can all be shoved into. If I watch a horror movie and want to describe it to you in words, I\u2019m stuck with a few simple low-res buckets\u2014\u201cscary\u201d or \u201ccreepy\u201d or \u201cchilling\u201d or \u201cintense.\u201d My actual impression of that movie is very specific and not exactly like any other movie I\u2019ve seen\u2014but the crude tools of language force my brain to \u201cround to the nearest bucket\u201d and choose the word that most closely resembles my actual impression, and that\u2019s the information you\u2019ll receive from me. You won\u2019t receive the thought\u2014you\u2019ll receive the bucket\u2014and now you\u2019ll have to guess which of the many nuanced impressions that all approximate to that bucket is the most similar to my impression of the movie. You\u2019ll decompress my description\u2014\u201cscary as shit\u201d\u2014into a high-res, nuanced thought that you associate with \u201cscary as shit,\u201d which will inevitably be based on your own experience watching other horror movies, and your own personality. The end result is that a lot has been lost in translation\u2014which is exactly what you\u2019d expect when you try to transfer a high-res file over a low-bandwidth medium, quickly, using low-res tools. That\u2019s why Elon calls language data transfer \u201clossy.\u201d\nWe do the best we can with these limitations\u2014and over time, we\u2019ve supplemented language with slightly higher-resolution formats like video to better convey nuanced imagery, or music to better convey nuanced emotion. But compared to the richness and uniqueness of the ideas in our heads, and the large-bandwidth straw our internal thoughts flow through, all human-to-human communication is very lossy.\nThinking about the phenomenon of communication as what it is\u2014brains trying to share things with each other\u2014you see the history of communication not as this:\n\nAs much as this:\n\nOr it could be put this way:\n\nIt really may be that the second major era of communication\u2014the 100,000-year Era of Indirect Communication\u2014is in its very last moments. If we zoom out on the timeline, it\u2019s possible the entire last 150 years, during which we\u2019ve suddenly been rapidly improving our communication media, will look to far-future humans like one concept: the transition from Era 2 to Era 3. We might be living on the line that divides timeline sections.\n\nAnd because indirect communication requires third-party body parts or digital parts, the end of Era 2 may be looked back upon as the era of physical devices. In an era where your brain is the device, there will be no need to carry anything around. You\u2019ll have your body and, if you want, clothes\u2014and that\u2019s it.\nWhen Elon thinks about wizard hats, this is usually the stuff he\u2019s thinking about\u2014communication bandwidth and resolution. And we\u2019ll explore why in Part 6 of this post.\nFirst, let\u2019s dig into the mind-boggling concept of your brain becoming a device and talk about what a wizard hat world might be like.\n___________\nOne thing to keep in mind as we think about all of this is that none of it will take you by surprise. You won\u2019t go from having nothing in your brain to a digital tertiary layer in your head, just like people didn\u2019t go from the Apple IIGS to using Tinder overnight. The Wizard Era will come gradually, and by the time the shift actually begins to happen, we\u2019ll all be very used to the technology, and it\u2019ll seem normal.\nSupporting this point is the fact the staircase up to the Wizard Era has already started, and you haven\u2019t even noticed. But there are thousands of people currently walking around with electrodes in their brain, like those with cochlear implants, retinal implants, and deep brain implants\u2014all benefiting from early BMIs.\nThe next few steps on the staircase will continue to focus on restoring lost function in different parts of the body\u2014the first people to have their lives transformed by digital brain technology will be the disabled. As specialized BMIs serve more and more forms of disability, the concept of brain implants will work its way in from the fringes and become something we\u2019re all used to\u2014just like no one blinks an eye when you say your friend just got Lasik surgery or your grandmother just got a pacemaker installed.\nElon talks about some types of people early BMIs could help:\nThe first use of the technology will be to repair brain injuries as a result of stroke or cutting out a cancer lesion, where somebody\u2019s fundamentally lost a certain cognitive element. It could help with people who are quadriplegics or paraplegics by providing a neural shunt from the motor cortex down to where the muscles are activated. It can help with people who, as they get older, have memory problems and can\u2019t remember the names of their kids, through memory enhancement, which could allow them to function well to a much later time in life\u2014the medically advantageous elements of this for dealing with mental disablement of one kind or another, which of course happens to all of us when we get old enough, are very significant.\nAs someone who lost a grandfather to dementia five years before losing him to death, I\u2019m excited to hear this.\nAnd as interface bandwidth improves, disabilities that hinder millions today will start to drop like flies. The concepts of complete blindness and deafness\u2014whether centered in the sensory organs or in the brain31\u2014are already on the way out. And with enough time, perfect vision or hearing will be restorable.\nProsthetic limbs\u2014and eventually sleek, full-body exoskeletons underneath your clothes\u2014will work so well, providing both outgoing motor functions and an incoming sense of touch, that paralysis or amputations will only have a minor long-term effect on people\u2019s lives.\nIn Alzheimer\u2019s patients, memories themselves are often not lost\u2014only the bridge to those memories. Advanced BMIs could help restore that bridge or serve as a new one.\nWhile this is happening, BMIs will begin to emerge that people without disabilities want. The very early adopters will probably be pretty rich. But so were the early cell phone adopters.52\n\nThat\u2019s Gordon Gekko, and that 1983, two-pound cell phone cost almost $9,000 in today\u2019s dollars. And now over half of living humans own a mobile phone\u2014all of them far less shitty than Gordon Gekko\u2019s.\nAs mobile phones got cheaper, and better, they went from new and fancy and futuristic to ubiquitous. As we go down the same road with brain interfaces, things are going to get really cool.\nBased on what I learned from my conversations with Elon, Ramez, and a dozen neuroscientists, let\u2019s look at what the world might look like in a few decades. The timeline is uncertain, including the order in which the below developments may become a reality. And, of course, some of the below predictions are sure to be way off the mark, just as there will be other developments in this field that won\u2019t be mentioned here because people today literally can\u2019t imagine them yet.\nBut some version of a lot of this stuff probably will happen, at some point, and a lot of it could be in your lifetime.\nLooking at all the predictions I heard, they seemed to fall into two broad categories: communication capabilities and internal enhancements.\nThe Wizard Era: Communication\n\nMotor communication\n\u201cCommunication\u201d in this section can mean human-to-human or human-to-computer. Motor communication is all about human-to-computer\u2014the whole \u201cmotor cortex as remote control\u201d thing from earlier, but now the unbelievably rad version.\nLike many future categories of brain interface possibility, motor communication will start with restoration applications for the disabled, and as those development efforts continually advance the possibilities, the technology will begin to be used to create augmentation applications for the non-disabled as well. The same technologies that will allow a quadriplegic to use their thoughts as a remote control to move a bionic limb can let anyone use their thoughts as a remote control\u2026to move anything. Well not anything\u2014I\u2019m not talking about telekinesis\u2014anything built to be used with a brain remote. But in the Wizard Era, lots of things will be built that way.\nYour car (or whatever people use for transportation at that point) will pull up to your house and your mind will open the car door. You\u2019ll walk up to the house and your mind will unlock and open the front door (all doors at that point will be built with sensors to receive motor cortex commands). You\u2019ll think about wanting coffee and the coffee maker will get that going. As you head to the fridge the door will open and after getting what you need it\u2019ll close as you walk away. When it\u2019s time for bed, you\u2019ll decide you want the heat turned down and the lights turned off, and those systems will feel you make that decision and adjust themselves.\nNone of this stuff will take any effort or thought\u2014we\u2019ll all get very good at it and it\u2019ll feel as automatic and subconscious as moving your eyes to read this sentence does to you now.\nPeople will play the piano with their thoughts. And do building construction. And steer vehicles. In fact, today, if you\u2019re driving somewhere and something jumps out in the road in front of you, what neuroscientists know is that your brain sees it and begins to react well before your consciousness knows what\u2019s going on or your arms move to steer out of the way. But when your brain is the one steering the car, you\u2019ll have swerved out of the way before you even realize what happened.\nThought communication\nThis is what we discussed up above\u2014but you have to resist the natural instinct to equate a thought conversation with a normal language conversation where you simply hear each other\u2019s voices in your head. As we discussed, words are compressed approximations of uncompressed thoughts, so why would you ever bother with any of that, or deal with lossiness, if you didn\u2019t have to? When you watch a movie, your head is buzzing with thoughts\u2014but do you have a compressed spoken word dialogue going on in your head? Probably not\u2014you\u2019re just thinking. Thought conversations will be like that.\nElon says:\nIf I were to communicate a concept to you, you would essentially engage in consensual telepathy. You wouldn\u2019t need to verbalize unless you want to add a little flair to the conversation or something (laughs), but the conversation would be conceptual interaction on a level that\u2019s difficult to conceive of right now.\nThat\u2019s the thing\u2014it\u2019s difficult to really understand what it would be like to think with someone. We\u2019ve never been able to try. We communicate with ourselves through thought and with everyone else through symbolic representations of thought, and that\u2019s all we can imagine.\nEven weirder is the concept of a group thinking together. This is what a group brainstorm could look like in the Wizard Era.\n\n    \n\nAnd of course, they wouldn\u2019t need to be in the same room. This group could have been in four different countries while this was happening\u2014with no external devices in sight.\nRamez has written about the effect group thinking might have on the world:\nThat type of communication would have a huge impact on the pace of innovation, as scientists and engineers could work more fluidly together. And it\u2019s just as likely to have a transformative effect on the public sphere, in the same way that email, blogs, and Twitter have successively changed public discourse.\nThe idea of collaboration today is supposed to be two or more brains working together to come up with things none of them could have on their own. And a lot of the time, it works pretty well\u2014but when you consider the \u201clost in transmission\u201d phenomenon that happens with language, you realize how much more effective group thinking would be.\nI asked Elon a question that pops into everyone\u2019s mind when they first hear about thought communication:\n\u201cSo, um, will everyone be able to know what I\u2019m thinking?\u201d\nHe assured me they would not. \u201cPeople won\u2019t be able to read your thoughts\u2014you would have to will it. If you don\u2019t will it, it doesn\u2019t happen. Just like if you don\u2019t will your mouth to talk, it doesn\u2019t talk.\u201d Phew.\nYou can also think with a computer. Not just to issue a command, but to actually brainstorm something with a computer. You and a computer could strategize something together. You could compose a piece of music together. Ramez talked about using a computer as an imagination collaborator: \u201cYou could imagine something, and the computer, which can better forward predict or analyze physical models, could fill in constraints\u2014and that allows you to get feedback.\u201d\nOne concern that comes up when people hear about thought communication in particular is a potential loss of individuality. Would this make us one great hive mind with each individual brain as just another bee? Almost across the board, the experts I talked to believed it would be the opposite. We could act as one in a collaboration when it served us, but technology has thus far enhanced human individuality. Think of how much easier it is for people today to express their individuality and customize life to themselves than it was 50 or 100 or 500 years ago. There\u2019s no reason to believe that trend won\u2019t continue with more progress.\nMultimedia communication\nSimilar to thought communication, but imagine how much easier it would be to describe a dream you had or a piece of music stuck in your head or a memory you\u2019re thinking about if you could just beam the thing into someone\u2019s head, like showing them on your computer screen. Or as Elon said, \u201cI could think of a bouquet of flowers and have a very clear picture in my head of what that is. It would take a lot of words for you to even have an approximation of what that bouquet of flowers looks like.\u201d\nHow much faster could a team of engineers or architects or designers plan out a new bridge or a new building or a new dress if they could beam the vision in their head onto a screen and others could adjust it with their minds, versus sketching things out\u2014which not only takes far longer, but probably is inevitably lossy?\nHow many symphonies could Mozart have written if he had been able to think the music in his head onto the page? How many Mozarts are out there right now who never learned how to play instruments well enough to get their talent out?\nI watched this delightful animated short movie the other day, and below the video the creator, Felix Colgrave, said the video took him two years. How much of that time was spent dreaming up the art versus painstakingly getting it from his head into the software? Maybe in a few decades, I\u2019ll be able to watch animation streaming live out of Felix\u2019s head.\nEmotional communication\nEmotions are the quintessential example of a concept that words are poorly-equipped to accurately describe. If ten people say, \u201cI\u2019m sad,\u201d it actually means ten different things. In the Wizard Era, we\u2019ll probably learn pretty quickly that the specific emotions people feel are as unique to people as their appearance or sense of humor.\nThis could work as communication\u2014when one person communicates just what they\u2019re feeling, the other person would be able to access the feeling in their own emotional centers. Obvious implications for a future of heightened empathy. But emotional communication could also be used for things like entertainment, where a movie, say, could also project out to the audience\u2014directly into their limbic systems\u2014certain feelings it wants the audience to feel as they watch. This is already what the film score does\u2014another hack\u2014and now it could be done directly.\nSensory communication\nThis one is intense.\nRight now, the only two microphones that can act as inputs for the \u201cspeaker\u201d in your head\u2014your auditory cortex\u2014are your two ears. The only two cameras that can be hooked up to the projector in your head\u2014your visual cortex\u2014are your two eyes. The only sensory surface that you can feel is your skin. The only thing that lets you experience taste is your tongue.\nBut in the same way we can currently hook an implant, for example, into someone\u2019s cochlea\u2014which connects a different mic to their auditory cortex\u2014down the road we\u2019ll be able to let sensory input information stream into your wizard hat wirelessly, from anywhere, and channel right into your sensory cortices the same way your bodily sensory organs do today. In the future, sensory organs will be only one set of inputs into your senses\u2014and compared to what our senses will have access to, not a very exciting one.\nNow what about output?\nCurrently, the only speaker your ear inputs can play out of is your auditory cortex. Only you can see what your eye cameras capture and only you can feel what touches your skin\u2014because only you have access to the particular cortices those inputs are wired to. With a wizard hat, it would be a breeze for your brain to beam those input signals out of your head.\nSo you\u2019ll have sensory input capabilities and sensory output capabilities\u2014or both at the same time. This will open up all kinds of amazing possibilities.\nSay you\u2019re on a beautiful hike and you want to show your husband the view. No problem\u2014just think out to him to request a brain connection. When he accepts, connect your retina feed to his visual cortex. Now his vision is filled with exactly what your eyes see, as if he\u2019s there. He asks for the other senses to get the full picture, so you connect those too and now he hears the waterfall in the distance and feels the breeze and smells the trees and jumps when a bug lands on your arm. You two share the equivalent of a five-minute discussion about the scene\u2014your favorite parts, which other places it reminds you of, etc. along with a shared story from his day\u2014in a 30-second thought session. He says he has to get back to what he was working on, so he cuts off the sense connections except for vision, which he reduces to a little picture-in-picture window on the side of his visual field so he can check out more of the hike from time to time.\nA surgeon could control a machine scalpel with her motor cortex instead of holding one in her hand, and she could receive sensory input from that scalpel so that it would feel like an 11th finger to her. So it would be as if one of her fingers was a scalpel and she could do the surgery without holding any tools, giving her much finer control over her incisions. An inexperienced surgeon performing a tough operation could bring a couple of her mentors into the scene as she operates to watch her work through her eyes and think instructions or advice to her. And if something goes really wrong, one of them could \u201ctake the wheel\u201d and connect their motor cortex to her outputs to take control of her hands.\nThere would be no more need for screens of course\u2014because you could just make a virtual screen appear in your visual cortex. Or jump into a VR movie with all your senses. Speaking of VR\u2014Facebook, the maker of the Oculus Rift, is diving into this too. In an interview with Mark Zuckerberg about VR (for an upcoming post), the conversation at one point turned to BMIs. He said: \u201cTouch gives you input and it\u2019s a little bit of haptic feedback. Over the long term, it\u2019s not clear that we won\u2019t just like to have our hands in no controller, and maybe, instead of having buttons that we press, we would just think something.\u201d\nThe ability to record sensory input means you can also record your memories, or share them\u2014since a memory in the first place is just a not-so-accurate playback of previous sensory input. Or you could play them back as live experiences. In other words, that Black Mirror episode will probably actually happen.\nAn NBA player could send out a livestream invitation to his fans before a game, which would let them see and hear through his eyes and ears while he plays. Those who miss it could jump into the recording later.\nYou could save a great sex experience in the cloud to enjoy again later\u2014or, if you\u2019re not too private a person, you could send it over to a friend to experience. (Needless to say, the porn industry will thrive in the digital brain world.)\nRight now, you can go on YouTube and watch a first-hand account of almost anything, for free. This would have blown George Washington\u2019s mind\u2014but in the Wizard Era, you\u2019ll be able to actually experience almost anything for free. The days of fancy experiences being limited to rich people will be long over.\nAnother idea, via the imagination of Moran Cerf: Maybe player brain injuries will drive the NFL to alter the rules so that the players\u2019 biological bodies stay on the sidelines, while they play the game with an artificial body whose motor cortex they control and whose eyes and ears they see and hear through. I like this idea and think it would be closer to the current NFL than it seems at first. In one way, you\u2019ll still need to be a great athlete to play, since most of what makes a great athlete great is their motor cortex, their muscle memory, and their decision-making. But the other component of being a great athlete\u2014the physical body itself\u2014would now be artificial. The NFL could make all of the artificial playing bodies identical\u2014this would be a cool way to see whose skills were actually best\u2014or they could insist that artificial body matches in every way the biological body of the athlete, to mimic as closely as possible how the game would go if players used their biological bodies like in the old days. Either way, if this rule change happened, you can imagine how crazy it would seem to people that players used to have their actual, fragile brains on the field.\nI could go on. The communication possibilities in a wizard hat world, especially when you combine them with each other, are endless\u2014and damn fun to think about.\nThe Wizard Era: Internal Control\n\nCommunication\u2014the flow of information into and out of your brain\u2014is only one way your wizard hat will be able to serve you.\nA whole-brain interface can stimulate any part of your brain in any way\u2014it has to have this capability for the input half of all the communication examples above. But that capability also gives you a whole new level of control over your brain. Here are some ways people of the future might take advantage of that:\nWin the battle in your head for both sides\nOften, the battle in our heads between our prefrontal cortex and limbic system comes down to the fact that both parties are trying to do what\u2019s best for us\u2014it\u2019s just that our limbic system is wrong about what\u2019s best for us because it thinks we live in a tribe 50,000 years ago.\nYour limbic system isn\u2019t making you eat your ninth Starburst candy in a row because it\u2019s a dick\u2014it\u2019s making you eat it because it thinks that A) any fruit that sweet and densely chewy must be super rich in calories and B) you might not find food again for the next four days so it\u2019s a good idea to load up on a high-calorie food whenever the opportunity arises.\nMeanwhile, your prefrontal cortex is just watching in horror like \u201cWHY ARE WE DOING THIS.\u201d\nBut Moran believes that a good brain interface could fix this problem:53\nConsider eating a chocolate cake. While eating, we feed data to our cognitive apparatus. These data provide the enjoyment of the cake. The enjoyment isn\u2019t in the cake, per se, but in our neural experience of it. Decoupling our sensory desire (the experience of cake) from the underlying survival purpose (nutrition) will soon be within our reach.\nThis concept of \u201csensory decoupling\u201d would make so much sense if we could pull it off. You could get the enjoyment of eating like shit without actually putting shit in your body. Instead, Moran says, what would go in your body would be \u201cnutrition inputs customized for each person based on genomes, microbiomes or other factors. Physical diets released from the tyranny of desire.\u201d54\nThe same principle could apply to things like sex, drugs, alcohol, and other pleasures that get people into trouble, healthwise or otherwise.\nRamez Naam talks about how a brain interface could also help us win the discipline battle when it comes to time:55\nWe know that stimulating the right centers in the brain can induce sleep or alertness, hunger or satiation, ease or stimulation, as quick as the flip of a switch. Or, if you\u2019re running code, on a schedule. (Siri: Put me to sleep until 7:30, high priority interruptions only. And let\u2019s get hungry for lunch around noon. Turn down the sugar cravings, though.)\nTake control of mood disorders\nRamez also emphasized that a great deal of scientific evidence suggests that moods and disorders are tied to what the chemicals in your brain are doing. Right now, we take drugs to alter those chemicals, and Ramez explains why direct neural stimulation is a far better option:56\nPharmaceuticals enter the brain and then spread out randomly, hitting whatever receptor they work on all across your brain. Neural interfaces, by contrast, can stimulate just one area at a time, can be tuned in real-time, and can carry information out about what\u2019s happening.\nDepression, anxiety, OCD, and other disorders may be easy to eradicate once we can take better control of what goes on in our brain.\nMess with your senses\nWant to hear what a dog hears? That\u2019s easy. The pitch range we can hear is limited by the dimensions of our cochlea\u2014but pitches out of the ear\u2019s range can be sent straight into our auditory nerve.32\nOr maybe you want a new sense. You love bird watching and want to be able to sense when there\u2019s a bird nearby. So you buy an infrared camera that can detect bird locations by their heat signals and you link it to your brain interface, which stimulates neurons in a certain way to alert you to the presence of a bird and tell you its location. I can\u2019t describe what you\u2019d experience when it alerts you, so I\u2019ll just say words like \u201cfeel\u201d or \u201csee,\u201d because I can only imagine the five senses we have. But in the future, there will be more words for new, useful types of senses.\nYou could also dim or shut off parts of a sense, like pain perhaps. Pain is the body\u2019s way of telling us we need to address something, but in the future, we\u2019ll elect to get that information in much less unpleasant formats.33\nIncrease your knowledge \nThere\u2019s evidence from experiments with rats that it\u2019s possible to boost how fast a brain can learn\u2014sometimes by 2x or even 3x\u2014just by priming certain neurons to prepare to make a long-term connection.\nYour brain would also have access to all the knowledge in the world, at all times. I talked to Ramez about how accessing information in the cloud might work. We parsed it out into four layers of capability, each requiring a more advanced brain interface than the last:\nLevel 1: I want to know a fact. I call on the cloud for that info\u2014like Googling something with my brain\u2014and the answer, in text, appears in my mind\u2019s eye. Basically what I do now except it all happens in my head.\nLevel 2: I want to know a fact. I call on the cloud for that info, and then a second later I just know it. No reading was involved\u2014it was more like the way I\u2019d recall something from memory.\nLevel 3: I just know the fact I want to know the second I want it. I don\u2019t even know if it came from the cloud or if it was stored in my brain. I can essentially treat the whole cloud like my brain. I don\u2019t know all the info\u2014my brain could never fit it all\u2014but any time I want to know something it downloads into my consciousness so seamlessly and quickly, it\u2019s as if it were there all along.\nLevel 4: Beyond just knowing facts, I can deeply understand anything I want to, in a complex way. We discussed the example of Moby Dick. Could I download Moby Dick from the cloud into my memory and then suddenly have it be the same as if I had read the whole book? Where I\u2019d have thoughts and opinions and I could cite passages and have discussions about the themes?\nRamez thinks all four of these are possible with enough time, but that the fourth in particular will take a very long time to happen, if ever.\nSo there are about 50 delightful potential things about putting a wizard hat on your brain. Now for the undelightful part.\nThe scary thing about wizard hats\nAs is always the case with the advent of new technologies, when the Wizard Era rolls around, the dicks of the world will do their best to ruin everything.\nAnd this time, the stakes are extra high. Here are some things that could suck:\nTrolls can have an even fielder day. The troll-type personalities of the world have been having a field day ever since the internet came out. They literally can\u2019t believe their luck. But with brain interfaces, they\u2019ll have an even fielder day. Being more connected to each other means a lot of good things\u2014like empathy going up as a result of more exposure to all kinds of people\u2014but it also means a lot of bad things. Just like the internet. Bad guys will have more opportunity to spread hate or build hateful coalitions. The internet has been a godsend for ISIS, and a brain-connected world would be an even more helpful recruiting tool.\nComputers crash. And they have bugs. And normally that\u2019s not the end of the world, because you can try restarting, and if it\u2019s really being a piece of shit, you can just get a new computer. You can\u2019t get a new head. There will have to be a way way higher number of precautions taken here.\nComputers can be hacked. Except this time they have access to your thoughts, sensory input, and memories. Bad times.\nHoly shit computers can be hacked. In the last item I was thinking about bad guys using hacking to steal information from my brain. But brain interfaces can also put information in. Meaning a clever hacker might be able to change your thoughts or your vote or your identity or make you want to do something terrible you normally wouldn\u2019t ever consider. And you wouldn\u2019t know it ever happened. You could feel strongly about voting for a candidate and a little part of you would wonder if someone manipulated your thoughts so you\u2019d feel that way. The darkest possible scenario would be an ISIS-type organization actually influencing millions of people to join their cause by altering their thoughts. This is definitely the scariest paragraph in this post. Let\u2019s get out of here.\nWhy the Wizard Era will be a good thing anyway even though there are a lot of dicks\nPhysics advancements allow bad guys to make nuclear bombs. Biological advancements allow bad guys to make bioweapons. The invention of cars and planes led to crashes that kill over a million people a year. The internet enabled the spread of fake news, made us vulnerable to cyberattack, made terrorist recruiting efforts easier, and allowed predators to flourish.\nAnd yet\u2014\nWould people choose to reverse our understanding of science, go back to the days of riding horses across land and boats across the ocean, or get rid of the internet?\nProbably not.\nNew technology also comes along with real dangers and it always does end up harming a lot of people. But it also always seems to help a lot more people than it harms. Advancing technology almost always proves to be a net positive.\nPeople also love to hate the concept of new technology\u2014because they worry it\u2019s unhealthy and makes us less human. But those same people, if given the option, usually wouldn\u2019t consider going back to George Washington\u2019s time, when half of children died before the age of 5, when traveling to other parts of the world was impossible for almost everyone, when a far greater number of humanitarian atrocities were being committed than there are today, when women and ethnic minorities had far fewer rights across the world than they do today, when far more people were illiterate and far more people were living under the poverty line than there are today. They wouldn\u2019t go back 250 years\u2014a time right before the biggest explosion of technology in human history happened. Sounds like people who are immensely grateful for technology. And yet their opinion holds\u2014our technology is ruining our lives, people in the old days were much wiser, our world\u2019s going to shit, etc. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve thought about it hard enough.\nSo when it comes to what will be a long list of dangers of the Wizard Era\u2014they suck, and they\u2019ll continue to suck as some of them play out into sickening atrocities and catastrophes. But a vastly larger group of good guys will wage war back, as they always do, and a giant \u201cbrain security\u201d industry will be born. And I bet, if given the option, people in the Wizard Era wouldn\u2019t for a second consider coming back to 2017.\n___________\nThe Timeline\nI always know when humanity doesn\u2019t know what the hell is going on with something when all the experts are contradicting each other about it.34\nThe timeline for our road to the Wizard Era is one of those times\u2014in large part because no one knows to what extent we\u2019ll be able to make Stevenson\u2019s Law look more like Moore\u2019s Law.\nMy conversations yielded a wide range of opinions on the timeline. One neuroscientist predicted that I\u2019d have a whole-brain interface in my lifetime. Mark Zuckerberg said: \u201cI would be pretty disappointed if in 25 years we hadn\u2019t made some progress towards thinking things to computers.\u201d One prediction on the longer end came from Ramez Naam, who thought the time of people beginning to install BMIs for reasons other than disability might not come for 50 years and that mass adoption would take even longer.\n\u201cI hope I\u2019m wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that Elon bends the curve on this.\u201d\nWhen I asked Elon about his timeline, he said:\nI think we are about 8 to 10 years away from this being usable by people with no disability \u2026 It is important to note that this depends heavily on regulatory approval timing and how well our devices work on people with disabilities.\nDuring another discussion, I had asked him about why he went into this branch of biotech and not into genetics. He responded:\nGenetics is just too slow, that\u2019s the problem. For a human to become an adult takes twenty years. We just don\u2019t have that amount of time.\nA lot of people working on this challenge have a lot of different motivations for doing so, but rarely did I talk to people who felt motivated by urgency.\nElon\u2019s urgency to get us into the Wizard Era is the final piece of the Neuralink puzzle. Our last box to fill in:\n\n\nWith Elon\u2019s companies, there\u2019s always some \u201cresult of the goal\u201d that\u2019s his real reason for starting the company\u2014the piece that ties the company\u2019s goal into humanity\u2019s better future. In the case of Neuralink, it\u2019s a piece that takes a lot of tree climbing to understand. But with the view from all the way up here, we\u2019ve got everything we need for our final stretch of the road.\nPart 6: The Great Merger\n\nImagine an alien explorer is visiting a new star and finds three planets circling it, all with life on them. The first happens to be identical to the way Earth was in 10 million BC. The second happens to be identical to Earth in 50,000 BC. And the third happens to be identical to Earth in 2017 AD.\nThe alien is no expert on primitive biological life but circles around all three planets, peering down at each with his telescope. On the first, he sees lots of water and trees and mountains and some little signs of animal life. He makes out a herd of elephants on an African plain, a group of dolphins skipping along the ocean\u2019s surface, and a few other scattered critters living out their Tuesday.\nHe moves on to the second planet and looks around. More critters, not too much different. He notices one new thing\u2014occasional little points of flickering light dotting the land.\nBored, he moves on to the third planet. Whoa. He sees planes crawling around above the land, vast patches of gray land with towering buildings on them, ships of all kinds sprinkled across the seas, long railways stretching across continents, and he has to jerk his spaceship out of the way when a satellite soars by him.\nWhen he heads home, he reports on what he found: \u201cTwo planets with primitive life and one planet with intelligent life.\u201d\nYou can understand why that would be his conclusion\u2014but he\u2019d be wrong.\nIn fact, it\u2019s the first planet that\u2019s the odd one out. Both the second and third planets have intelligent life on them\u2014equally intelligent life. So equal that you could kidnap a newborn baby from Planet 2 and swap it with a newborn on Planet 3 and both would grow up as normal people on the other\u2019s planet, fitting in seamlessly. Same people.\nAnd yet, how could that be?\n\nThe Human Colossus. That\u2019s how.\nEver wonder why you\u2019re so often unimpressed by humans and yet so blown away by the accomplishments of humanity?\nIt\u2019s because humans are still, deep down, those people on Planet 2.\nPlop a baby human into a group of chimps and ask them to raise him, Tarzan style, and the human as an adult will know how to run around the forest, climb trees, find food, and masturbate. That\u2019s who each of us actually is.\nHumanity, on the other hand, is a superintelligent, tremendously-knowledgeable, millennia-old Colossus, with 7.5 billion neurons. And that\u2019s who built Planet 3.\nThe invention of language allowed each human brain to dump its knowledge onto a pile before its death, and the pile became a tower and grew taller and taller until one day, it became the brain of a great Colossus that built us a civilization. The Human Colossus has been inventing things ever since, getting continually better at it with time. Driven only by the desire to create value, the Colossus is now moving at an unprecedented pace\u2014which is why we live in an unprecedented and completely anomalous time in history.\nYou know how I said we might be living literally on the line between two vast eras of communication?\nWell the truth is, we seem to be on a lot of historic timeline boundaries. After 1,000 centuries of human life and 3.8 billion years of Earthly life, it seems like this century will be the one where Earth life makes the leap from the Single-Planetary Era to the Multi-Planetary Era. This century may be the one when an Earthly species finally manages to wrest the genetic code from the forces of evolution and learns to reprogram itself. People alive today could witness the moment when biotechnology finally frees the human lifespan from the will of nature and hands it over to the will of each individual.\nThe Human Colossus has reached an entirely new level of power\u2014the kind of power that can overthrow 3.8-billion-year eras\u2014positioning us on the verge of multiple tipping points that will lead to unimaginable change. And if our alien friend finds a fourth planet one day that happens to be identical to Earth in 2100, you can be pretty damn sure it\u2019ll look nothing to him like Planet 3.\nI hope you enjoyed Planet 3, because we\u2019re leaving it. Planet 4 is where we\u2019re headed, whether we like it or not.\n\n__________\nIf I had to sum up the driving theme behind everything Elon Musk does, it would be pretty simple:\nHe wants to prepare us for Planet 4.\nHe lives in the big picture, and his only lens is the maximum zoom-out. That\u2019s why he\u2019s such an unusual visionary. It\u2019s also why he\u2019s so worried.\nIt\u2019s not that he thinks Planet 4 is definitely a bad place\u2014it\u2019s that he thinks it could be a bad place, and he recognizes that the generations alive today, whether they realize it or not, are the first in history to face real, hardcore existential risk.\nAt the same time, the people alive today also are the first who can live with the actually realistic hope for a genuinely utopian future\u2014one that defies even death and taxes. Planet 4 could be our promised land.\nWhen you zoom way out, you realize how unfathomably high the stakes actually are.\nAnd the outcome isn\u2019t at the whim of chance\u2014it\u2019s at the whim of the Human Colossus. Planet 4 is only coming because the Colossus is building it. And whether that future is like heaven or hell depends on what the Colossus does\u2014maybe over the next 150 years, maybe over only the next 50. Or 25.\nBut the unfortunate thing is that the Human Colossus isn\u2019t optimized to maximize the chances of a safe transition to the best possible Planet 4 for the most possible humans\u2014it\u2019s optimized to build Planet 4, in any way possible, as quickly as possible.\nUnderstanding all of this, Elon has dedicated his life to trying to influence the Human Colossus to bring its motivation more in line with the long-term interests of humans. He knows it\u2019s not possible to rewire the Human Colossus\u2014not unless existential risk were suddenly directly in front of each human\u2019s face, which normally doesn\u2019t happen until it\u2019s already too late\u2014so he treats the Colossus like a pet.\nIf you want your dog to sit, you correlate sitting on command with getting a treat. For the Human Colossus, a treat is a ripe new industry simultaneously exploding in both supply and demand.\nElon saw the Human Colossus dog peeing on the floor in the form of continually adding ancient, deeply-buried carbon into the carbon cycle\u2014and rather than plead with the Colossus to stop peeing on the floor (which a lot of people waste their breath doing) or try to threaten the Colossus into behaving (which governments try to do, with limited success), he\u2019s creating an electric car so rad that everyone will want one. The auto industry sees the shift in consumer preferences this is beginning to create, and in the nine years since Tesla released its first car, the number of major car companies with an electric car in their line went from zero to almost all of them. The Colossus seems to be taking the treat, and a change in behavior may follow.\nElon saw the Human Colossus dog running into traffic in the form of humanity keeping all of its eggs on one planet, despite all of those tipping points on the horizon, so he built SpaceX to learn to land a rocket, which will cut the cost of space travel by about 99% and make dedicating resources to the space industry a much tastier morsel for the Colossus. His plan with Mars isn\u2019t to try to convince humanity that it\u2019s a good idea to build a civilization there in order to buy life insurance for the species\u2014it\u2019s to create an affordable regular cargo and human transit route to Mars, knowing that once that happens, there will be enough value-creation opportunity in Mars development that the Colossus will become determined to make it happen.\nBut to Elon, the scariest thing the Human Colossus is doing is teaching the Computer Colossus to think. To Elon, and many others, the development of superintelligent AI poses by far the greatest existential threat to humanity. It\u2019s not that hard to see why. Intelligence gives us godlike powers over all other creatures on Earth\u2014which has not been a fun time for the creatures. If any of their body parts are possible value creators, we have major industries processing and selling those body parts. We sometimes kill them for sport. But we\u2019re probably the least fun all the times we\u2019re just doing our thing, for our own reasons, with no hate in our hearts or desire to hurt anyone, and there are creatures, or ecosystems, that just happen to be in our way or in the line of fire of the side effects of what we\u2019re doing. People like to get all mad at humanity about this, but really, we\u2019re just doing what species do\u2014being selfish, first and foremost.\nThe issue for other creatures isn\u2019t our selfishness\u2014it\u2019s the immense damage our selfishness can do because of the tremendous power we have over them. Power that comes from our intelligence advantage.\nSo it\u2019s pretty logical to be apprehensive about the prospect of intentionally creating something that will have (perhaps far) more intelligence than we do\u2014especially since every human on the planet is an amateur at creating something like that, because no one has ever done it before.\nAnd things are progressing quickly. Elon talked about the rapid progress made by Google\u2019s game-playing AI:\nI mean, you\u2019ve got these two things where AlphaGo crushes these human players head-on-head, beats Lee Sedol 4 out of 5 games and now it will beat a human every game all the time, while playing the 50 best players, and beating them always, all the time. You know, that\u2019s like one year later. \nAnd it\u2019s on a harmless thing like AlphaGo right now. But the degrees of freedom at which the AI can win are increasing. So, Go has many more degrees of freedom than Chess, but if you take something like one of the real-time strategy competitive games like League of Legends or Dota 2, that has vastly more degrees of freedom than Go, so it can\u2019t win at that yet. But it will be able to. And then there\u2019s reality, which has the ultimate number of degrees of freedom.35\nAnd for reasons discussed above, that kind of thing worries him:\nWhat I came to realize in recent years\u2014the last couple years\u2014is that AI is obviously going to surpass human intelligence by a lot. \u2026 There\u2019s some risk at that point that something bad happens, something that we can\u2019t control, that humanity can\u2019t control after that point\u2014either a small group of people monopolize AI power, or the AI goes rogue, or something like that. It may not, but it could.\nBut in typical Human Colossus form, \u201cthe collective will is not attuned to the danger of AI.\u201d\nWhen I interviewed Elon in 2015, I asked him if he would ever join the effort to build superintelligent AI. He said, \u201cMy honest opinion is that we shouldn\u2019t build it.\u201d And when I later commented that building something smarter than yourself did seem like a basic Darwinian error (a phrase I stole from Nick Bostrom), Elon responded, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win the Darwin Award, collectively.\u201d\nNow, two years later, here\u2019s what he says:\nI was trying to really sound the alarm on the AI front for quite a while, but it was clearly having no impact (laughs) so I was like, \u201cOh fine, okay, then we\u2019ll have to try to help develop it in a way that\u2019s good.\u201d\nHe\u2019s accepted reality\u2014the Human Colossus is not going to quit until the Computer Colossus, one day, wakes up. This is happening.\n\nNo matter what anyone tells you, no one knows what will happen when the Computer Colossus learns to think. In my long AI explainer, I explored the reasoning of both those who are convinced that superintelligent AI will be the solution to every problem we have, and those who see humanity as a bunch of kids playing with a bomb they don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m personally still torn about which camp I find more convincing, but it seems pretty rational to plan for the worst and do whatever we can to increase our odds. Many experts agree with that logic, but there\u2019s little consensus on the best strategy for creating superintelligent AI safely\u2014just a whole lot of ideas from people who acknowledge they don\u2019t really know the answer. How could anyone know how to take precautions for a future world they have no way to understand?\nElon also acknowledges he doesn\u2019t know the answer\u2014but he\u2019s working on a plan he thinks will give us our best shot.\nElon\u2019s Plan\nAbraham Lincoln was pleased with himself when he came up with the line:\n\u2014and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\nFair\u2014it\u2019s a good line.\nThe whole idea of \u201cof the people, by the people, for the people\u201d is the centerpiece of democracy.\nUnfortunately, \u201cthe people\u201d are unpleasant. So democracy ends up being unpleasant. But unpleasant tends to be a dream compared to the alternatives. Elon talked about this:\nI think that the protection of the collective is important. I think it was Churchill who said, \u201cDemocracy\u2019s the worst of all systems of government, except for all the others.\u201d It\u2019s fine if you have Plato\u2019s incredible philosopher king as the king, sure. That would be fine. Now, most dictators do not turn out that way. They tend to be quite horrible.\nIn other words, democracy is like escaping from a monster by hiding in a sewer.\nThere are plenty of times in life when it\u2019s a good strategy to take a risk in order to give yourself a chance for the best possible outcome, but when the stakes are at their absolute highest, the right move is usually to play it safe. Power is one of those times. That\u2019s why, even though democracy essentially guarantees a certain level of mediocrity, Elon says, \u201cI think you\u2019re hard-pressed to find many people in the United States who, no matter what they think of any given president, would advocate for a dictatorship.\u201d\nAnd since Elon sees AI as the ultimate power, he sees AI development as the ultimate \u201cplay it safe\u201d situation. Which is why his strategy for minimizing existential AI risk seems to essentially be that AI power needs to be of the people, by the people, for the people.\nTo try to implement that concept in the realm of AI, Elon has approached the situation from multiple angles.\nFor the by the people and for the people parts, he and Sam Altman created OpenAI\u2014a self-described \u201cnon-profit AI research company, discovering and enacting the path to safe artificial general intelligence.\u201d\nNormally, when humanity is working on something new, it starts with the work of a few innovative pioneers. When they succeed, an industry is born and the Human Colossus jumps on board to build upon what the pioneers started, en masse.\nBut what if the thing those pioneers were working on was a magic wand that might give whoever owned it immense, unbreakable power over everyone else\u2014including the power to prevent anyone else from making a magic wand? That would be kinda stressful, right?\nWell that\u2019s how Elon views today\u2019s early AI development efforts. And since he can\u2019t stop people from trying to make a magic wand, his solution is to create an open, collaborative, transparent magic wand development lab. When a new breakthrough innovation is discovered in the lab, instead of making it a tightly-kept secret like the other magic wand companies, the lab publishes the innovation for anyone to see or borrow for their own magic-wand-making efforts.\nOn one hand, this could have drawbacks. Bad guys are out there trying to make a magic wand too, and you really don\u2019t want the first magic wand to end up in the hands of a bad guy. And now the bad guys\u2019 development efforts can benefit from all of the innovations being published by the lab. This is a serious concern.\nBut the lab also boosts the efforts of millions of other people trying to create magic wands. This generates a ton of competition for the secretive early pioneers, and it becomes less likely that any one inventor can create a magic wand long before others also do. More likely is that when the first magic wand is eventually created, there are thousands of others near completion as well\u2014different wands, with different capabilities, made by different people, for different reasons. If we have to have magic wands on Earth, Elon thinks, let\u2019s at least make sure they\u2019re in the hands of a large number of people across the world\u2014not one all-powerful sorcerer. Or as he puts it:\nEssentially, if everyone\u2019s from planet Krypton, that\u2019s great. But if only one of them is Superman and Superman also has the personality of Hitler, then we\u2019ve got a problem.\nMore broadly, a single pioneer\u2019s magic wand would likely have been built to serve that inventor\u2019s own needs and purposes. But by turning the future magic wand industry into a collective effort, a wide variety of needs and purposes will have a wand made for them, making it more likely that the capabilities of the world\u2019s aggregate mass of magic wands will overarchingly represent the needs of the masses.\nYou know, like democracy.\nIt worked fine for Nikola Tesla and Henry Ford and the Wright Brothers and Alan Turing to jump-start revolutions by jumping way out ahead of the pack. But when you\u2019re dealing with the invention of something unthinkably powerful, you can\u2019t sit back and let the pioneers kick things off\u2014it\u2019s leaving too much to chance.\nOpenAI is an effort to democratize the creation of AI, to get the entire Human Colossus working on it during its pioneer phase. Elon sums it up:\nAI is definitely going to vastly surpass human abilities. To the degree that it is linked to human will, particularly the sum of a large number of humans, it would be an outcome that is desired by a large number of humans, because it would be a function of their will.\nSo now you\u2019ve maybe got early human-level-or-higher AI superpower being made by the people, for the people\u2014which brings down the likelihood that the world\u2019s AI ends up in the hands of a single bad guy or a tightly-controlled monopoly.\nNow all we\u2019ve got left is of the people.\nThis one should be easy. Remember, the Human Colossus is creating superintelligent AI for the same reason it created cars, factory machines, and computers\u2014to serve as an extension of itself to which it can outsource work. Cars do our walking, factory machines do our manufacturing, and computers take care of information storage, organization, and computation.\nCreating computers that can think will be our greatest invention yet\u2014they\u2019ll allow us to outsource our most important and high-impact work. Thinking is what built everything we have, so just imagine the power that will come from building ourselves a superintelligent thinking extension. And extensions of the people by definition belong to the people\u2014they\u2019re of the people.\nThere\u2019s just this one thing\u2014\nHigh-caliber AI isn\u2019t quite like those other inventions. The rest of our technology is great at the thing it\u2019s built to do, but in the end, it\u2019s a mindless machine with narrow intelligence. The AI we\u2019re trying to build will be smart, like a person\u2014like a ridiculously smart person. It\u2019s a fundamentally different thing than we\u2019ve ever made before\u2014so why would we expect normal rules to apply?\nIt\u2019s always been an automatic thing that the technology we make inherently belongs to us\u2014it\u2019s such an obvious point that it almost seems silly to make it. But could it be that if we make something smarter than a person, it might not be so easy to control?\nCould it be that a creation that\u2019s better at thinking than any human on Earth might not be fully content to serve as a human extension, even if that\u2019s what it was built to do?\nWe don\u2019t know how issues will actually manifest\u2014but it seems pretty safe to say that yes, these possibilities could be.\nAnd if what could be turns out to actually be, we may have a serious problem on our hands.\nBecause, as the human history case study suggests, when there\u2019s something on the planet way smarter than everyone else, it can be a really bad thing for everyone else. And if AI becomes the new thing on the planet that\u2019s way smarter than everyone else, and it turns out not to clearly belong to us\u2014it means that it\u2019s its own thing. Which drops us into the category of \u201ceveryone else.\u201d\nSo people gaining monopolistic control of AI is its own problem\u2014and one that OpenAI is hoping to solve. But it\u2019s a problem that may pale in comparison to the prospect of AI being uncontrollable.\nThis is what keeps Elon up at night. He sees it as only a matter of time before superintelligent AI rises up on this planet\u2014and when that happens, he believes that it\u2019s critical that we don\u2019t end up as part of \u201ceveryone else.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why, in a future world made up of AI and everyone else, he thinks we have only one good option:\nTo be AI.\n___________\nRemember before when I said that there were two things about wizard hats we had to wrap our heads around?\n1) The intensely mind-bending idea\n2) The super ridiculously intensely mind-bending idea\nThis is where #2 comes in.\nThese two ideas are the two things Elon means when he refers to the wizard hat as a digital tertiary layer in our brains. The first, as we discussed, is the concept that a whole-brain interface is kind of the same thing as putting our devices in our heads\u2014effectively making your brain the device. Like this: \nYour devices give you cyborg superpowers and a window into the digital world. Your brain\u2019s wizard hat electrode array is a new brain structure, joining your limbic system and cortex.\nBut your limbic system, cortex, and wizard hat are just the hardware systems. When you experience your limbic system, it\u2019s not the physical system you\u2019re interacting with\u2014it\u2019s the information flow within it. It\u2019s the activity of the physical system that bubbles up in your consciousness, making you feel angry, scared, horny, or hungry.\nSame thing for your cortex. The napkin wrapped around your brain stores and organizes information, but it\u2019s the information itself that you experience when you think something, see something, hear something, or feel something. The visual cortex in itself does nothing for you\u2014it\u2019s the stream of photon information flowing through it that gives you the experience of having a visual cortex. When you dig in your memory to find something, you\u2019re not searching for neurons, you\u2019re searching for information stored in the neurons.\nThe limbic system and cortex themselves are just gray matter. The flow of activity within the gray matter is what forms your familiar internal characters, the monkey brain and the rational human brain.\nSo what does that mean about your digital tertiary layer?\nIt means that while what\u2019s actually in your brain is the physical device\u2014the electrode array itself\u2014the component of the tertiary layer that you\u2019ll experience and get to know as a character is the information that flows through the array.\nAnd just like the feelings and urges of the limbic system and the thoughts and chattering voice of the cortex all feel to you like parts of you\u2014like your inner essence\u2014the activity that flows through your wizard hat will feel like a part of you and your essence.\nElon\u2019s vision for the Wizard Era is that among the wizard hat\u2019s many uses, one of its core purposes will be to serve as the interface between your brain and a cloud-based customized AI system. That AI system, he believes, will become as present a character in your mind as your monkey and your human characters\u2014and it will feel like you every bit as much as the others do. He says:\nI think that, conceivably, there\u2019s a way for there to be a tertiary layer that feels like it\u2019s part of you. It\u2019s not some thing that you offload to, it\u2019s you.\nThis makes sense on paper. You do most of your \u201cthinking\u201d with your cortex, but then when you get hungry, you don\u2019t say, \u201cMy limbic system is hungry,\u201d you say, \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d Likewise, Elon thinks, when you\u2019re trying to figure out the solution to a problem and your AI comes up with the answer, you won\u2019t say, \u201cMy AI got it,\u201d you\u2019ll say, \u201cAha! I got it.\u201d When your limbic system wants to procrastinate and your cortex wants to work, a situation I might be familiar with, it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re arguing with some external being, it feels like a singular you is struggling to be disciplined. Likewise, when you think up a strategy at work and your AI disagrees, that\u2019ll be a genuine disagreement and a debate will ensue\u2014but it will feel like an internal debate, not a debate between you and someone else that just happens to take place in your thoughts. The debate will feel like thinking. \nIt makes sense on paper.\nBut when I first heard Elon talk about this concept, it didn\u2019t really feel right. No matter how hard I tried to get it, I kept framing the idea as something familiar\u2014like an AI system whose voice I could hear in my head, or even one that I could think together with. But in those instances, the AI still seemed like an external system I was communicating with. It didn\u2019t seem like me.\nBut then, one night while working on the post, I was rereading some of Elon\u2019s quotes about this, and it suddenly clicked. The AI would be me. Fully. I got it.\nThen I lost it. The next day, I tried to explain the epiphany to a friend and I left us both confused. I was back in \u201cWait, but it kind of wouldn\u2019t really be me, it would be communicating with me\u201d land. Since then, I\u2019ve dipped into and out of the idea, never quite able to hold it for long. The best thing I can compare it to is having a moment when it actually makes sense that time is relative and space-time is a single fabric. For a second, it seems intuitive that time moves slower when you\u2019re moving really fast. And then I lose it. As I typed those sentences just now, it did not seem intuitive.\nThe idea of being AI is especially tough because it combines two mind-numbing concepts\u2014the brain interface and the abilities it would give you, and artificial general intelligence. Humans today are simply not equipped to understand either of those things, because as imaginative as we think we are, our imaginations only really have our life experience as their toolkit, and these concepts are both totally novel. It\u2019s like trying to imagine a color you\u2019ve never seen.\nThat\u2019s why when I hear Elon talk with conviction about this stuff, I\u2019m somewhere in between deeply believing it myself and taking his word for it. I go back and forth. But given that he\u2019s someone who probably found space-time intuitive when he was seven, and given that he\u2019s someone who knows how to colonize Mars, I\u2019m inclined to listen hard to what he says.\nAnd what he says is that this is all about bandwidth. It\u2019s obvious why bandwidth matters when it comes to making a wizard hat useful. But Elon believes that when it comes to interfacing with AI, high bandwidth isn\u2019t just preferred, but actually fundamental to the prospect of being AI, versus simply using AI. Here he is walking me through his thoughts:\nThe challenge is the communication bandwidth is extremely slow, particularly output. When you\u2019re outputting on a phone, you\u2019re moving two thumbs very slowly. That\u2019s crazy slow communication. \u2026 If the bandwidth is too low, then your integration with AI would be very weak. Given the limits of very low bandwidth, it\u2019s kind of pointless. The AI is just going to go by itself, because it\u2019s too slow to talk to. The faster the communication, the more you\u2019ll be integrated\u2014the slower the communication, the less. And the more separate we are\u2014the more the AI is \u201cother\u201d\u2014the more likely it is to turn on us. If the AIs are all separate, and vastly more intelligent than us, how do you ensure that they don\u2019t have optimization functions that are contrary to the best interests of humanity? \u2026 If we achieve tight symbiosis, the AI wouldn\u2019t be \u201cother\u201d\u2014it would be you and with a relationship to your cortex analogous to the relationship your cortex has with your limbic system.\nElon sees communication bandwidth as the key factor in determining our level of integration with AI, and he sees that level of integration as the key factor in how we\u2019ll fare in the AI world of our future:\nWe\u2019re going to have the choice of either being left behind and being effectively useless or like a pet\u2014you know, like a house cat or something\u2014or eventually figuring out some way to be symbiotic and merge with AI.\nThen, a second later:\nA house cat\u2019s a good outcome, by the way.\nWithout really understanding what kinds of AI will be around when we reach the age of superintelligent AI, the idea that human-AI integration will lend itself to the protection of the species makes intuitive sense. Our vulnerabilities in the AI era will come from bad people in control of AI or rogue AI not aligned with human values. In a world in which millions of people control a little piece of the world\u2019s aggregate AI power\u2014people who can think with AI, can defend themselves with AI, and who fundamentally understand AI because of their own integration with it\u2014humans are less vulnerable. People will be a lot more powerful, which is scary, but like Elon said, if everyone is Superman, it\u2019s harder for any one Superman to cause harm on a mass scale\u2014there are lots of checks and balances. And we\u2019re less likely to lose control of AI in general because the AI on the planet will be so widely distributed and varied in its goals. \nBut time is of the essence here\u2014something Elon emphasized:\nThe pace of progress in this direction matters a lot. We don\u2019t want to develop digital superintelligence too far before being able to do a merged brain-computer interface.\nWhen I thought about all of this, one reservation I had was whether a whole-brain interface would be enough of a change to make integration likely. I brought this up with Elon, noting that there would still be a vast difference between our thinking speed and a computer\u2019s thinking speed. He said:\nYes, but increasing bandwidth by orders of magnitude would make it better. And it\u2019s directionally correct. Does it solve all problems? No. But is it directionally correct? Yes. If you\u2019re going to go in some direction, well, why would you go in any direction other than this?\nAnd that\u2019s why Elon started Neuralink.\n\nHe started Neuralink to accelerate our pace into the Wizard Era\u2014into a world where he says that \u201ceveryone who wants to have this AI extension of themselves could have one, so there would be billions of individual human-AI symbiotes who, collectively, make decisions about the future.\u201d A world where AI really could be of the people, by the people, for the people.\n\n___________\nI\u2019ll guess that right now, some part of you believes this insane world we\u2019ve been living in for the past 38,000 words could really maybe be the future\u2014and another part of you refuses to believe it. I\u2019ve got a little of both of those going on too.\nBut the insanity part of it shouldn\u2019t be the reason it\u2019s hard to believe. Remember\u2014George Washington died when he saw 2017. And our future will be unfathomably shocking to us. The only difference is that things are moving even faster now than they were in George\u2019s time.\nThe concept of being blown away by the future speaks to the magic of our collective intelligence\u2014but it also speaks to the naivety of our intuition. Our minds evolved in a time when progress moved at a snail\u2019s pace, so that\u2019s what our hardware is calibrated to. And if we don\u2019t actively override our intuition\u2014the part of us that reads about a future this outlandish and refuses to believe it\u2019s possible\u2014we\u2019re living in denial.\nThe reality is that we\u2019re whizzing down a very intense road to a very intense place, and no one knows what it\u2019ll be like when we get there. A lot of people find it scary to think about, but I think it\u2019s exciting. Because of when we happened to be born, instead of just living in a normal world like normal people, we\u2019re living inside of a thriller movie. Some people take this information and decide to be like Elon, doing whatever they can to help the movie have a happy ending\u2014and thank god they do. Because I\u2019d rather just be a gawking member of the audience, watching the movie from the edge of my seat and rooting for the good guys.\nEither way, I think it\u2019s good to climb a tree from time to time to look out at the view and remind ourselves what a time this is to be alive. And there are a lot of trees around here. Meet you at another one sometime soon.\n_______\n\nIf you like Wait But Why, sign up for our email list and we\u2019ll send you new posts when they come out.\nTo support Wait But Why, visit our Patreon page.\nRidiculous of wildebeest to not be spelled wildebeast.\u21a9A guy recently hand-wrote the Bible and it took him 13 years. Imagine how expensive books would be if they took 13 years to make (and if there were no other way to get that information).\u21a9There are currently 49 known Gutenberg Bibles still in existence\u2014many viewable in museums in major cities.\u21a9The math checks out on that stat. Gutenberg and his team produced 180 Bibles in two years, and a Gutenberg Bible is 1,286 pages long, which works out to 317 pages/day on average. A healthy 13-hour work day at 25 pages/hour would do the trick.\u21a9For example, while ass-deep in Google Images looking for some brain-related diagram last week, I came across this immensely satisfying shit. Such a great punchline at the last step, when I was already thrilled by how many iterations of coil there were and then I realized that the big big coil is what makes up the tiny scramble that makes up a chromosome. Chromosomes are intense. Then, just now, when I went back to Google Images to find a higher-res version of the diagram to link to here, I looked at related diagrams for ten minutes. Time-sucking curiosity diversions are always an issue for me during science/tech-related posts, but this one was a particular rabbit hole hell (heaven) for me. I\u2019ll put some of the best not-that-related nuggets I found into footnotes.\u21a9The skull is only about 6.5mm thick in women and 7.1mm in men\u2014like a quarter-inch. I thought it was thicker than that.\u21a9Delightful/upsetting tidbit: your eyes are connected directly to the brain by nerves and muscle fibers. So if you opened someone\u2019s head and took out their brain, what would come out is their brain, their spinal cord (attached to the bottom)\u2014and their dangling eyes.\u21a9One thing I learned from that video is that the two hard bumps on the lower part of the back of your head, just above your neck, are the indents in the skull where the two lobes of the cerebellum sit\u2014so that\u2019s right where your cerebellum is.\u21a9To add to the difficulties, as humans evolved, they became bipedal (upright on two legs), which reduced the size of the female pelvis (otherwise women wouldn\u2019t have been able to run). Evolution pulled a cool trick to reconcile the situation\u2014babies started being born while they were still fetuses. This is why newborns look like Winston Churchill for the first month or so before they become cute\u2014they\u2019re really supposed to still be in the womb. It\u2019s also why newborn babies are so incredibly helpless at first.\u21a9That\u2019s enough surface area, that even at only 2mm thick, the cortex has a volume of 400-500cm3, over a third of the total volume of the brain, and about the same volume as a softball.\u21a9Another scientist, Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal, made the official discovery 15 years later.\u21a9Not quite touching actually\u2014there\u2019s about a 20-40nm gap in between.\u21a9The often-discussed dopamine and serotonin are both neurotransmitters.\u21a9Multiple sclerosis is caused by a glitch in the body\u2019s immune system that causes it to destroy the myelin sheaths of neurons, which as you can see from the GIF below, would seriously disrupt the body\u2019s ability to communicate with itself. ALD, the disease in Lorenzo\u2019s Oil, is also caused by myelin being destroyed.\u21a9Via the world\u2019s greatest procrastination site, Kottke.org\u21a9Tidbit: A neurosurgeon explained to me how a knockout punch works. Gray and white matter have different densities. So when your head is punched hard, or you get a really bad concussion, what can happen if your head snaps back and forth really sharply is that the gray and white matter accelerate at different velocities, which can make the gray matter of your cortex slide a bit over the white matter, or the white matter slide a bit over the gray matter of the brain stem. In the latter case, for a brief moment, your cortex is separated from being able to communicate with your brainstem. And since your consciousness resides in the brain stem, it makes you go unconscious. When either type of sliding happens, it can tear a bunch of axons. In a minor axon tear where the myelin sheath is still intact, the axon can grow back and heal. But if it\u2019s a sharp enough blow, the myelin sheaths can tear too and the axons will never grow back\u2014permanent brain damage. Concussions are really, really bad. This is also why an uppercut to the bottom of the chin or a blow to the back of the head can cause loss of consciousness\u2014because those blows make the head snap back and forth sharply\u2014while a punch to the side of the head or to the forehead won\u2019t cause loss of consciousness.\u21a9If our stick guy neuron were one of those sensory neurons, drawn to scale, his torso-axon would have been about a kilometer long.\u21a9Sometimes, like when you step on a nail or touch a hot stove, the sensory axons will communicate with relevant motor neurons directly in the spinal cord to create an immediate reflex to pull your foot or hand away. This is called a \u201creflex arc.\u201d\u21a9It really feels like the plural of soma should be soma.\u21a9The science world used to believe there were as many as ten times the number of glial cells as neurons in the brain, but that number has come down with more recent research.\u21a9Here\u2019s a silly video of a scientist explaining what a connectome is five times, to five people of all different levels.\u21a9Really tiny\u20141/100th the diameter of a human hair. Here\u2019s a delightful video of one being made.\u21a9I\u2019m not the one making this sexual. The patch clamp is making it sexual.\u21a9Researcher Andrew Schwartz compares the number of electrodes used to a political poll, and says \u201cthe more neurons you poll, the better the result.\u201d\u21a9Though some in the BMI industry found this less than impressive.\u21a9Full Wait But Why explainer on sound here.\u21a9Through using a few sound engineering tricks, cochlear implant developers have allowed 16 electrodes to actually function as if there were seven additional electrodes in between each pair, bringing the total effect to the equivalent 121 electrodes.\u21a9This is a super interesting firsthand account of the experience of getting the implant.\u21a9One neuroscientist talked about putting devices into gaps formerly occupied by blood vessels, making the brain think the device is a blood vessel.\u21a9DARPA seems to be the source of a good amount of controversy. I haven\u2019t dug into it myself, but for what it\u2019s worth, every expert I talked to feels that DARPA is an important piece of the puzzle and is working almost entirely on projects intended to help wounded veterans.\u21a9The retinal implants we talked about are for people whose eyes are damaged. But blindness can take place in the brain for many people. Early work is being done for this type of blindness, which involves working directly with a patient\u2019s visual cortex.\u21a9Tidbit: While dogs and cats can both hear pitches beyond the human ear\u2019s high end (hence the concept of dog whistles), apparently neither animal can hear things as low as humans\u2014including the lowest seven keys on the piano. I only read this\u2014people with dogs and cats and pianos should test this out.\u21a9Your pain pathways could be rerouted to the cloud\u2014to your medical AI\u2014which would either make the repairs itself by stimulating the right patterns of neurons to command some kind of repair within your body, or order the necessary medicine to be delivered to you with instructions. If you injured something like your ankle and it was important for you to keep your weight off of it, your brain could remind you of that in a lot of ways\u2014a sound alert, another type of feeling sensation, etc.\u2014none of which would hurt.\u21a9Classic example: the Fermi Paradox\u21a9He added, \u201cOr what appears to be reality\u201d to the end of that quote. But let\u2019s leave that can of worms for another time.\u21a9Wikimedia Commons.\u21a9Wikipedia. Yup, this is the second time I\u2019m referencing Wikipedia. I feel like the whole \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly unprofessional and irresponsible to reference Wikipedia\u201d thing is kind of outdated?

That leaves 16 or 17 hours awake each day. Or about 1,000 minutes.\nLet\u2019s think about those 1,000 minutes as 100 10-minute blocks. That\u2019s what you wake up with every day.\n\nThroughout the day, you spend 10 minutes of your life on each block, until you eventually run out of blocks and it\u2019s time to go to sleep.\n\nIt\u2019s always good to step back and think about how we\u2019re using those 100 blocks we get each day. How many of them are put towards making your future better, and how many of them are just there to be enjoyed? How many of them are spent with other people, and how many are for time by yourself? How many are used to create something, and how many are used to consume something? How many of the blocks are focused on your body, how many on your mind, and how many on neither one in particular? Which are your favorite blocks of the day, and which are your least favorite?\nImagine these blocks laid out on a grid. What if you had to label each one with a purpose?\n\nYou\u2019d have to think about everything you might spend your time doing in the context of its worth in blocks. Cooking dinner requires three blocks, while ordering in requires zero\u2014is cooking dinner worth three blocks to you? Is 10 minutes of meditation a day important enough to dedicate a block to it? Reading 20 minutes a night allows you to read 15 additional books a year\u2014is that worth two blocks? If your favorite recreation is playing video games, you\u2019d have to consider the value you place on fun before deciding how many blocks it warrants. Getting a drink with a friend after work takes up about 10 blocks. How often do you want to use 10 blocks for that purpose, and on which friends? Which blocks should be treated as non-negotiable in their labeled purpose and which should be more flexible? Which blocks should be left blank, with no assigned purpose at all?\n\nNow imagine a similar grid, but one where each block is labeled exactly how you spent it yesterday.\nThe question to ask is: How are the two grids different from each other, and why?\n___________\nTip: the above grid is printable if you click on it.\n___________\nWhile we\u2019re all in this mood:\nYour whole life on a grid.\nA stark reminder.\nAnd if you\u2019re sitting down with a printed grid, this might be a good post to read first.\n_______\n\nIf you like Wait But Why, sign up for our email list and we\u2019ll send you

Here\u2019s what happened:\nMartha Raddatz: Hi I\u2019m Martha.\nAnderson Cooper: And I\u2019m Anderson. And we\u2019ll be your moderators tonight.\nMartha: We\u2019d like to remind all audience members that they\u2019re props more than anything and should stay silent through the debate. The format of the debate will be a series of questions from members of the audience. We\u2019ll start with a woman named Patrice Brock.\nAudience Question: Thank you and good evening. The last presidential debate could have been rated as MA\u2014mature audiences\u2014per TV parental guidelines. Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students\u2019 homework, do you feel that you are modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today\u2019s youth?\nClinton: I want to do all kinds of things. I want to do good things. There\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t do together, you and me Patrice. I want to work with people of all ethnicities. I want to heal the country. Make it a better place. For you and for me and the entire human race. And our children. And grandchildren.\nTrump: This country\u2019s going to shit. Healthcare costs are going up. We made Iran great again. We get killed on trade\u2014an $800 billion deficit last year. We\u2019re gonna make great trade deals. We\u2019re gonna bring back law and order. Did you hear about those policemen that were shot today? We need justice. I want to fix the blacks in the cities. I want to fix the Latinos, Hispanics, etc. I want to make them great again. Make America great again.\nAnderson Cooper: Neither of you remotely answered the question, whatsoever. You literally both ignored Patrice. Anyway, I also don\u2019t care about Patrice. Let\u2019s talk about the tapes. Donald, you talked about kissing women without consent. Grabbing them by the pussy. That\u2019s really very much definitely sexual assault. You bragged about sexually assaulting women. This is a real thing that happened. It is a thing that\u2019s real.\nTrump: Wrong. I don\u2019t think you understand what sexual assault is. Grabbing women by the pussy is locker room talk. Assaulting women is grabbing them by the pussy. I\u2019m sorry I grabbed women by the pussy. I never did that. And how can you say that\u2019s worse than ISIS? ISIS is beheading thousands of people. How can you compare me to ISIS? They drown people in steel cages. I\u2019ve never done that once. How dare you Anderson. We\u2019ll see tomorrow what the American people have to say about you saying that ISIS isn\u2019t a big deal. What do you think our enemies are saying when they see what\u2019s going on here. Yes, it was locker room talk. Yes, I hate it. I have advanced strategies for ISIS. I will defeat ISIS.\nAnderson:\nTrump:\nAnderson: Okay, but do you assault women?\nTrump: Nobody has more respect for women than I do. Nobody. Not Mister Rogers. Not Susan B. Anthony. No one. Moving on a married woman is a sign of respect. I\u2019m what every parent hopes their daughter marries. All women respect me.\nAnderson: But like literally\u2014do you assault women?\nTrump: Only with my respect. We\u2019re gonna build a wall. We\u2019re gonna have borders. People are pouring into our country from the Middle East to grab American women by the pussy. We\u2019re gonna make America safe again. We\u2019re gonna make America great again. We\u2019re gonna make America safe again. We\u2019re gonna make America wealthy again. China.\nAnderson: Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?\nClinton: Reagan. Bush. Eisenhower. Did they grab women by the arm? Yes. By the hand? Probably. Around the shoulder? Sure. But by the pussy? I don\u2019t think so. Donald Trump is a bad man. He\u2019s an everything-ist. He\u2019s Matt Damon in School Ties. He\u2019s the uncle in The Long Walk Home. He\u2019s the mean slave owner in 12 Years a Slave. He\u2019s the main German guy in Die Hard. He\u2019s the woman in The Grudge. He\u2019s Bluto. He\u2019s Jafar. He\u2019s the Joker. He\u2019s a white walker. He\u2019s a death eater. He\u2019s a zombie. He\u2019s a ghost. I, on the other hand, want to form one of those huge circles of different colored people that stretches all the way around the Earth where everyone\u2019s holding hands. Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?\nTrump: 30 years. 30 years this lady\u2019s running the country and never once have I, nor has anyone else, been part of a circle of different colored people that stretches all the way around the Earth where everyone\u2019s holding hands. 30 years of this fucking lady and never once did she paint anything with paint, let alone the colors of the wind.\nMartha: Okay but back to your locker room assault. You\u2019ve said that this campaign has changed you\u2014that though being a clear predator in that video at the age of 59, you\u2019ve now become good. Is that really true?\nTrump: Martha\u2014I don\u2019t know how much clearer I can make this. I told detailed assault stories that included specific dates, names, and body parts. That\u2019s just classic locker room talk. Every guy talks to other guys about detailed stories of his previous assaults that include specific dates, names, and body parts. You don\u2019t know this because you\u2019re not there\u2014but whenever guys are alone, they talk about their previous assaults. That doesn\u2019t mean they assaulted anyone. Unless they\u2019re Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton is a bad fucking dude. Bill Clinton told me about when he held a Taco Bell employee down by the neck in the restaurant\u2019s utilities closet and had intercourse with her. Bill Clinton told me about having a foursome with Chelsea\u2019s three best friends while Chelsea was sleeping upstairs. Hillary missed it because she was busy laughing at a 12-year-old rape victim who by coincidence is sitting right over there.\nMartha: Nicely done. Hillary?\nClinton: I\u2019ll let Michelle Obama do the talking here. She said, \u201cWhen someone talks about that time when your husband held a Taco Bell employee down by the neck in the restaurant\u2019s utilities closet and had intercourse with her, you go high.\u201d Also, you insulted a Muslim war hero\u2019s parents and said a Latino judge was inherently biased and mocked a disabled reporter and said Obama was foreign.\nTrump: The first three, sure. But you\u2019re the one who said Obama was foreign. Also, Michelle Obama has openly said you\u2019re the worst ever. Also, you cheated to beat Bernie Sanders. Also, you deleted 33,000 emails you sneaky fuck. And when I\u2019m F\u00fchrer, I\u2019m hiring a special prosecutor to come after you.\nClinton: He\u2019s lying about everything, it\u2019s all on my website, and let\u2019s just be happy that this loose cannon isn\u2019t in charge of the law in this country.\nTrump: Because you\u2019d be in jail.\nAudience: Oh dayome!\nAnderson: We\u2019d like to remind the audience to stop being a piece of shit.\nMartha: But really, Hillary\u2014what\u2019s up with the emails you sneaky fuck.\nClinton: It was a mistake. I wrote 33,000 emails about Chelsea\u2019s wedding and a yoga class, and I shouldn\u2019t have deleted them. Now let\u2019s get to the questions from the audience.\nTrump: Of course\u2014anything to divert from this question, you crooked shrew.\nClinton: Anything to divert from your campaign, you incompressible jizztrumpet.\nAnderson: That\u2019s enough. Now let\u2019s resume this town hall farce with our second audience question.\nTrump: Typical.\nAnderson: Huh?\nTrump: You never ask Hillary about her emails. You never spend time with me. You don\u2019t care about me. This is one on three.\nAnderson: No it\u2019s not. Just a little. Next question.\nAudience Question: Obamacare made things more expensive, not less. How will you bring healthcare costs down?\nTrump: Well\u2014\nAnderson: No Hillary\u2019s supposed to go first here.\nClinton: No it\u2019s fine I\u2019d rather go second.\nTrump: No it\u2019s fine you go first.\nClinton: No you.\nTrump: No you.\nClinton: No you.\nTrump: No you.\nClinton: No you.\nTrump: No you.\nClinton: Obamacare is good.\nTrump: Obamacare is a disaster.\nAnderson: Hillary, your husband Bill also said Obamacare is a disaster.\nClinton: No he didn\u2019t.\nTrump: Bernie Sanders says Hillary has bad judgment.\nAnderson: Let\u2019s move on. Audience question.\nAudience Question: I\u2019m a Muslim. How can you help me not be hatecrimed?\nTrump: Being hatecrimed is a shame. But we have a problem. Which is that you\u2019re not telling us when the other Muslims are gonna kill us. In San Bernardino, there were Muslims that killed us and you didn\u2019t tell us about them. If you had told us about them, we could have stopped it. I don\u2019t think you ever told us about Orlando either, or 9/11 for that matter. I know that because if you had told us about 9/11, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019d be famous, and famous people don\u2019t go to town hall meetings.\nClinton: You are Muslim. I am Muslim. Captain Khan, who died serving this country and who Donald hates, was Muslim.\nMartha: Hey Donald, remember your Muslim ban? Let\u2019s discuss.\nTrump: I love Captain Khan. I have his name tattooed on my lower back. An American hero. Who Hillary killed by starting the Iraq War, another thing I hate.\nMartha: Fuckin\u2014dude\u2014no. Answer the question.\nTrump: Who made you so mean? Was it your parents?\nMartha: Does the Muslim ban still hold?\nTrump: Hillary wants to merge the US with Syria into one nation. She wants to increase the number of refugees from 10,000 to 65,000.\nMartha: What the fuck Hillary?\nClinton: That picture of the dead four-year-old boy on the beach with the little sneakers.\nMartha: Totes.\nClinton: Also, Donald literally wants to ban an entire major religion from entering the US. Can we just all reflect on that for a second? And also, he started the Iraq War, not me.\nTrump: I was against the war in Iraq.\nClinton: No you weren\u2019t.\nTrump: Yes I was.\nClinton: No you weren\u2019t.\nTrump: Yes I was.\nClinton: No you weren\u2019t.\nTrump: Yes I was. Bernie Sanders says Hillary Clinton has bad judgment.\nMartha: Okay new question. Hillary, you said in a secret speech that politicians need both a public and private position on certain issues. Is it okay for politicians to be two-faced?\nClinton: That was Abraham Lincoln, not me. More importantly, Trump is obsessed with Putin.\nTrump: I\u2019m not obsessed with Putin. I paid taxes. I took deductions. Hillary\u2019s friends took deductions. Hillary is friends with rich people.\nAnderson: The fuck? Okay well now that we\u2019re here:\nAudience Question: How will you ensure that wealthy Americans pay their fair share of taxes?\nTrump: Well the first thing I\u2019d do is (by the way one of the first provisions is (by the way you know I give up a lot when I run cause I change the tax code (by the way you know she could have done this years ago but she didn\u2019t because her rich friends don\u2019t want her to (30 fucking years, folks\u201430 years with this lady and nothing changes\u2014nothing ever will change)))) get rid of carried interest. I\u2019m also lowering taxes on the wealthy, and by the way Hillary is raising your taxes, which is a disaster. There\u2019s no growth in this country. This country\u2019s going to shit. China\u2019s killing us.\nClinton: Literally all lies from this douche again. He will cut taxes for the super rich and raise them for the middle class.\nTrump: Yeah and she\u2019ll close corporate loopholes\u2014as long as they\u2019re ones her rich friends don\u2019t use. Also, Bernie Sanders says she has bad judgment. 30 fucking years, folks, with this lady. 30\u2014\nClinton: 30 years my dick, Donald. I\u2019ve done 400 legislation things in 30 years.\nTrump: Nah.\nMartha: New question. Aleppo\u2019s in the shit. Thoughts?\nClinton: We need to stand up to Russia and Assad and save Aleppo.\nTrump: And save who in Aleppo, the rebels? They\u2019re worse than Assad. We need to fight ISIS.\nMartha: But Mr. Trump, your running mate agrees with Hillary. He even wants to use military force to stand up to Russia and Assad.\nTrump: Well he\u2019s dumb. We need to be fighting ISIS. I know more about ISIS than the generals.\nClinton: Fucking no you don\u2019t.\nAnderson: Audience question.\nAudience Question: Do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the US? \nTrump: I want to help all Americans. The black Americans. The Latino Americanos personas. The Indian chiefs. Our cities are a disaster. Our education is a disaster. Poverty is a disaster. Natural disasters are a disaster. She said basket of deplorables.\nClinton: I want to help all Americans\u2014the deplorables and the non-deplorables. I talked to an Ethopian kid who was scared of Trump.\nAnderson: But what\u2019s up with the deplorables thing?\nClinton: I only meant that truthfully, not publicly.\nTrump: She has tremendous hate in her heart. The hate in her heart is a disaster.\nAnderson: So Donald, remember when you kind of woke up in the middle of the night the other night and went on a 3am tirade attacking that random woman and telling people to watch her sex tape? What was\u2026what was the deal with that?\nTrump: That slut.\nAnderson: Let\u2019s move on to the next question, from a man named Kenneth Bone.\nAudience Question: I\u2019m Kenneth Bone. I\u2019m Kenneth Bone and I\u2019m wearing this sweater. And this is my mustache.\nAnderson: Is that. Is that it?\nKenneth Bone: What\u2019s your plan with energy policy?\nTrump: Coal. Coal is the way of the future. China is KILLING us. China is dumping steel on us.\nClinton: China is dumping steel on your shitty face. You buy a ton of Chinese steel. Climate change is a thing. Coal is a thing. Things are things.\nMartha: Okay last question, thank fucking god.\nAudience Question: It sounds kind of fun and hilarious to make you two say something nice about each other. Go.\nClinton: His kids aren\u2019t terrible people. Somehow.\nTrump: The bitch can fight.\nAnderson: I\u2019d like to extend my thanks and apologies to the 790 million people who watched this. Goodnight.\n_______\n\nIf you like Wait But Why, sign up for our email list and we\u2019ll send you new posts when they come out.\nTo support Wait But Why, visit our Patreon page.\n___________\nIf you

Buy it here. (Or see a preview.)\nYesterday, Elon Musk got on stage at the 2016 International Astronautical Congress and unveiled the first real details about the big fucking rocket they\u2019re making.\nA couple months ago, when SpaceX first announced that this would be happening in late September, it hit me that I might still have special privileges with them, kind of grandfathered in from my time working with Elon and his companies in 2015 (which resulted in an in-depth four-part blog series). So I reached out and asked if I could learn about the big fucking rocket ahead of time and write a post about it.\nThey said yes.\nA little while later, I got on a call with Elon to discuss the rocket, the timeline, and the big plan this was all a part of. We started off how we always do.\n\n\nThen I brought up the rocket.\n\n\n\n\nEventually, we were able to settle in to a fascinating conversation about this insane machine SpaceX is building and what\u2019s going to happen with it.\nNow, before we get into things\u2014\nThis post is only a piece of The SpaceX Story\u2014one of the most amazing stories of our time\u2014and a story I spent three months and 40,000 words telling last year. If you really want to understand this and you haven\u2019t read that post yet, I recommend you start there. The post has three parts, divided into five pages:\nPart 1: The Story of Humans and Space\nPart 2: Musk\u2019s Mission\nPart 3: How to Colonize Mars\u2192 Phase 1: Figure out how to put things into space\u2192 Phase 2: Revolutionize the cost of space travel\u2192 Phase 3: Colonize Mars\nFor those who have read the post and want a refresher or those who just want to hear about the big fucking rocket and move on with their day, here\u2019s a quick overview of the background:\nThe Context\nTo understand why the big fucking rocket matters, you have to understand this sentence:\nSpaceX is trying to make human life multi-planetary by building a self-sustaining, one-million-person civilization on Mars.\nLet\u2019s go part by part.\nWhy make human life multi-planetary?\nTwo reasons:\n1) It\u2019s fun and exciting. (Here\u2019s a clip from one of the interviews I did with Elon last year where he articulates this point.)\n2) It\u2019s not a great idea to have all of our eggs in one basket. Right now we\u2019re all on Earth, which means that if something terrible happens on Earth\u2014caused by nature or by our own technology\u2014we\u2019re done. That\u2019s like having a precious digital photo album saved only on one not-necessarily-reliable hard drive. If you were in that situation, you\u2019d be smart to back the album up on a second hard drive. That\u2019s the idea here. Elon calls it \u201clife insurance for the species.\u201d\nWhy Mars?\nVenus is a dick, with its lead-melting temperatures, its crushing atmospheric pressure, and its unbearable winds.\nThe moon has few natural resources, a 29-day day, and with no atmosphere to either provide protection against the sun during the day or warm things up at night, both day and night become murderous. Same deal on Mercury.\nJupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are just huge balls of gas pretending to be planets.\nCertain moons of Jupiter and Saturn are possibly habitable, but they\u2019re farther away and colder and darker than Mars, so why would we do that.\nPluto is even farther and colder and darker. Stop asking me about Pluto.\nThat leaves Mars. Mars isn\u2019t a good time. If Mars were a place on Earth, it\u2019s somewhere no one would want to go. But compared to all of those other options, it\u2019s a dream. It\u2019s cold but not that cold. It\u2019s kind of dark but not that much darker than Earth. It\u2019s far but not that far. Its day is almost the same length as ours, which is nice for us and hugely helpful for growing Earthly vegetation. Its surface gravity isn\u2019t crazy low or crazy high (it\u2019s around a third of Earth\u2019s). It has a ton of (frozen) water and a decent amount of CO2, which are critical for early attempts at living there and hugely helpful for future attempts to \u201cterraform\u201d the planet into a place more livable for humans. All things considered, we\u2019re very lucky to have an option as good as Mars\u2014in most other solar systems, we probably wouldn\u2019t.\nWhy 1,000,000 people?\nBecause Elon thinks that\u2019s a rough estimate for the number of people you\u2019d need to have on Mars in order for the Mars civilization to be \u201cself-sustaining\u201d\u2014with self-sustaining defined by Elon as: \u201cEven if the spaceships from Earth permanently stop coming, the colony doesn\u2019t eventually die out\u2014which requires a huge industrial base, and a much harder industrial base to create than being on Earth.\u201d\nIn other words, if hard drive #2 relies on hard drive #1 in order to stay working, then your photo album isn\u2019t really backed up, is it? The whole point of hard drive #2 is to save the day if hard drive #1 permanently crashes.\nAnd while the Earth hard drive could \u201ccrash\u201d for many exciting reasons\u2014an asteroid hits us, AI kills us, Trump kills us, ISIS creates some upsetting biological weapon, etc.\u2014Elon also warns about the less dramatic possibility that the Earth ships stop coming simply because Earth civilization stops having the capability to send them:\nThe spaceships from Earth could stop coming for other reasons\u2014it could be WWIII, it could be that Earth becomes a religious state, it could be some gradual decline where Earth civilization just sinks under its own weight. At one point the Egyptians were able to build pyramids, and then they forgot how to do that. And then they forgot how to read hieroglyphics, until the Rosetta Stone. Rome as well\u2014they had indoor plumbing, they had advanced aqueducts, and then that fell apart. China at one point had the world\u2019s biggest fleet of sailing ships and they were sailing as far as Africa, then some crazy emperor came along and decided that was bad and had them all burnt. So you just don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen. The key threshold to pass is the number of people and tons of cargo required to make things self-sustaining. And that\u2019s probably something like a million people and probably something like 10-100 million tons of cargo.\nIn other words, let\u2019s not wait on this.\nGreat, but how the hell do you bring 1,000,000 people to Mars?\nYou make this green part exist:\n\nIt\u2019s kind of simple. If we get to a point where there are a million people on Earth who both want to go to Mars and can afford to go to Mars, there will be a million people on Mars.\nUnfortunately, right now the yellow circle is tiny and the blue circle doesn\u2019t exist.\nElon thinks\u2014and I kind of do too\u2014that if the blue circle can get big enough, the yellow circle will take care of itself. If Mars is affordable and safe and you know you\u2019ll be able to come back, a lot of people will want to go.\nThe hard part is the blue circle. Here\u2019s the issue:\nLast time the US Congress checked with NASA, the cost to send a five-person crew to Mars was $50 billion. $10 billion a person. Elon thinks that to make the blue circle sufficiently large, it needs to cost $500,000 a person. 1/20,000 of the current cost.\n1/20,000.\nThat\u2019s like looking at the car industry and saying, \u201cRight now a new Honda costs around $20,000. To make this a viable industry, we need to get the cost of a new car down to $1.\u201d\nSo what the hell?\nHere\u2019s the hell:\nImagine if the way planes worked was that they took off, flew to their destination, but then instead of landing, all the passengers parachuted down to the ground and then the plane landed by smashing into the ocean and blowing up. So every plane flew exactly once, and to have a new flight happen, you\u2019d have to build another plane.\nA plane ticket would cost $1.5 million.\nSpace travel is currently so expensive mostly because we land rockets by crashing them into the ocean (or incinerating them in the atmosphere).\nWhen Elon started SpaceX, he was determined to fix this problem. It was a tall order, given that no one had ever done it before\u2014including nations like the US and Russia who had spent billions trying. But SpaceX puzzled away at the problem year after year, and after trying and failing a bunch of times, in late 2015, they nailed it:\n\nThen they nailed it again. And again. And again. Now they nail it more often than not. Here\u2019s a daytime view of a recent landing:\n\nSoon, for the first time, a previously used-and-landed, flight-tested Falcon 9 will carry out a new mission for SpaceX, officially making SpaceX rockets \u201creusable.\u201d\nTo fly a mission on a used rocket, you only need to pay for propellant (fuel and liquid oxygen) and a bit of routine maintenance. This cuts the price of space travel down by 100 or even 1,000 times.\nThat leaves us with somewhere between 19/20 and 199/200 of the cost left to cut. Part of that will happen when SpaceX takes 100 or more people to Mars at a time, instead of five (the number Congress asked NASA about). The rest of it is taken care of by a few simple innovations, like refueling the spaceships in orbit (which lowers the cost by 5-10x) and manufacturing propellant on Mars so you don\u2019t have to carry your return propellant with you (which lowers the cost by another 5-10x). More on those things later.\nSuddenly, not only can the price get down to $500,000/ticket, it can probably go even lower (Elon thinks it could eventually cost under $100,000/person). You may not have noticed it yet, but SpaceX\u2019s innovations are in the process of creating a total revolution in the cost of space travel\u2014a change that will open doors we can\u2019t imagine being open today. And when that revolution goes far enough, SpaceX\u2019s vision of putting 1,000,000 people on Mars really\u2014actually\u2014seriously\u2014may happen.\nWe\u2019re going to Mars. And this week, SpaceX showed us the thing that\u2019s gonna take us there.\nThe Rocket\n\u201cIt\u2019s so mind-blowing. It blows my mind, and I see it every week.\u201d\nElon\u2019s pumped. And when you learn about the big fucking rocket he\u2019s building, you\u2019ll understand why.\nFirst, let\u2019s absorb the challenge at hand. It\u2019s often said that space is hard. To this day, only a few hundred people have been in space, only a few countries have the ability to launch something into space, and the history of human space travel is littered with tragic launch failures. Firing something super heavy and delicate and full of explosive liquid up through the atmosphere without anything going wrong is incredibly hard.\nBut when we talk about humans going into space, we\u2019re talking mostly about humans going into Low Earth Orbit, a layer of space between 100 and 1,200 miles above the ground\u2014and normally, they\u2019re headed only 250 miles up to the International Space Station. The only time humans have gone farther were the small handful of Americans who made it out to the moon in the 1960s, traveling about 250,000 miles away.\nWhen Earth and Mars are at their closest, Mars is somewhere between 34 and 60 million miles away\u2014about 200 times farther away than the moon and about 200,000 times farther away than the ISS.\nThe moon is just over one light second away.\n\nMars is more than three light minutes away.\nMars is far.\nElon likes to compare the Earth-to-Mars trip to crossing the Atlantic Ocean, noting that using that scale, going to the moon would only be crossing the English Channel (and going to the ISS would be going to a dock 117 feet off the shore). Continuing with that comparison, he says, \u201cA rocket made to go to Low Earth Orbit or even the moon is basically like a coastal fishing vessel, compared to a colonial transport system that is trying to go 1,000 times further.\u201d\nOn top of that, it might be worth it to take only a few humans or a single satellite up into Low Earth Orbit\u2014but if you\u2019re going all the way to Mars, you want to take a lot more than that. So you have to take much more mass, much further. Multiplying the distance factor by the payload factor, Elon explains that a Mars transport system \u201cis like literally a million times more capable than what the current world launch system can do. It has to be.\u201d\nIt also has to be incredibly advanced. Elon says, \u201cIt\u2019s not just bigger, it needs to be more efficient. There\u2019s a false dichotomy when it comes to rockets of \u2018small and complex\u2019 or \u2018big and dumb.\u2019 People talk about the \u2018big dumb booster\u2019\u2014that won\u2019t work. You need a big smart booster. If you want to build a Mars colony, you have no choice\u2014 you have to make it big and efficient.\u201d\nSo that\u2019s all you have to do\u2014build a rocket that\u2019s a million times more capable than today\u2019s best rockets but who\u2019s also efficient and smart and great in bed.\nSpaceX is building it. Meet the Big Fucking Rocket.1\n\nHard to quite understand the bigness from that picture. So let\u2019s add in some scale:\n\nOr how about this?\n\nIt would barely fit diagonally across a football field without going into the stands.\nThere\u2019s also this:\n\nIt\u2019s a skyscraper. Or as Elon puts it, \u201cby far the biggest flying object ever.\u201d\nIn yesterday\u2019s presentation, Elon explained that this isn\u2019t a first crack at how it might look, or an artist\u2019s impression of how it might look\u2014it\u2019s how it\u2019s going to look. This is the thing they\u2019re building.\nUnfortunately, SpaceX seems to be going through an existential crisis when it comes to naming this thing\u2014first it was the Mars Colonial Transporter, then (because it can go way past Mars) it was renamed the Interplanetary Transport System, then yesterday in the presentation, Elon said they haven\u2019t actually settled on a name yet but that the specific spaceship that makes the maiden voyage to Mars might be called Heart of Gold1\u2014so no one knows what to call it.\nWhich is why\u2014until I hear otherwise\u2014I\u2019ll be calling it something I once heard Elon describe it as in an interview: the Big Fucking Rocket (BFR).\nThe Big Fucking Rocket is fucking big. At 400 feet tall, it\u2019s the height of a 40-story skyscraper. At 40 feet in diameter, a school bus could fit entirely underneath its footprint. It\u2019s more than three times the mass and generates over three times the thrust of the gargantuan Saturn V\u2014the rocket used in the Apollo mission\u2014which currently stands as by far the biggest rocket humanity has made.\nHere\u2019s how it stacks up next to a bunch of other rockets in size:\n\nThe difference is even more extreme when you compare the rockets by how many kilograms of payload (i.e. cargo and/or people) they can each take to orbit:\n\nFor comparison, SpaceX\u2019s badass Falcon 9 rocket will be able to take about 4 tons of payload to Mars, and the Falcon Heavy\u2014which is about to be today\u2019s most powerful rocket\u2014will be able to take about 13 tons to Mars. Elon believes the BFR will be able to take a few hundred tons of payload to Mars at first and eventually be able to take 1,000 tons. The absurdity of that statistic\u2014that the behemoth Falcon Heavy can only manage a little over 1% of the BFR\u2019s ultimate Mars payload\u2014is pretty hard to absorb.\nNow, to be clear\u2014what I\u2019ve been calling the Big Fucking Rocket this whole time is actually two things: a Big Fucking Spaceship sitting on top of a Big Fucking Booster.\n\nThe Big Fucking Booster\nLet\u2019s start by talking about the booster. The 25-story-high booster\u2014AKA the actual rocket of the BFR\u2014is what Elon calls \u201cquite a beast.\u201d It\u2019s the biggest booster of all time\u2014by far. By physical size, definitely, but even more so by thrust.\nIn the SpaceX post, I talked about the Falcon 9\u2019s nine Merlin engines, and how each one was powerful enough to lift a stack of 40 cars up into the sky\u2014in total, that meant the Falcon 9 set of engines could lift 360 cars. The Falcon Heavy, with its 27 Merlin engines, could lift a stack of over 1,000 cars up past the clouds.2\nThe Big Fucking Booster sits atop a different kind of engine: the Raptor.\n\nThe Raptor engine looks a lot like a Merlin, with one key difference\u2014by significantly increasing the pressure, SpaceX has made the Raptor over three times more powerful than a Merlin.\nA single Raptor engine produces 310 tons of thrust\u2014enough to lift 310 tons, or a stack of 172 cars, or an entire Boeing 747 airplane, into the sky. That\u2019s what one Raptor can do.3\nAnd the BFB has 42 of them.4\n\nAll together, that\u2019s an unheard of 13,033 tons of thrust, enough to push more than 7,000 cars\u2014or 50 large airplanes\u2014up to space.\nThe Big Fucking Spaceship\nSo then there\u2019s the spacecraft\u2014which SpaceX calls the Interplanetary Spaceship, and which I\u2019m going to keep calling the Big Fucking Spaceship because it\u2019s more fun. The BFS is the big cool-looking thing on top of the BFB (in case you\u2019re getting Big Fucking Confused\u2014the Big Fucking Spaceship (BFS) on top of the Big Fucking Booster (BFB) together make what I\u2019ve been calling the Big Fucking Rocket (BFR)). The BFS is what will take the people and cargo to Mars. It\u2019s also what will launch, on its own, off Mars and return to Earth with people who want to come back.\nThe BFS is itself the size of a tall, 16-story building, and is 55 feet wide at its thickest point. In addition to hundreds, and eventually a thousand tons of cargo, the BFS will be able to carry as many as 100 people at the beginning, and Elon believes that number could grow to 200 and even above 300 people over time\u2014like a cruise ship.\nWith nine Raptor engines, it\u2019ll have more liftoff thrust on its own than any of today\u2019s rockets\u2014including next year\u2019s Falcon Heavy. For a second-stage, cargo-carrying spacecraft to pack more thrust than even the most powerful first-stage rockets is outrageous.\nHere\u2019s a cross-section up close:\n\nI asked Elon what it\u2019ll be like to ride in it. He said, \u201cWell, you\u2019d be in a giant spaceship in microgravity.5 I mean, it would be pretty fun. You\u2019d be floating around.\u201d\nGood point.\nIn the presentation Q&A, he added: \u201cIt has to be really fun and exciting, it can\u2019t feel cramped or boring. The crew compartment is set up so that you can do zero-g games, you can float around, there will be movies, lecture halls, cabins, a restaurant\u2014it\u2019ll be really fun to go.\u201d\nUm, yeah, get me on that shit now. A zero gravity cruise ship. With this view:\n\nAnd if you were to go, here\u2019s how the whole thing would work:\n1) Get on the ship. The BFR will be taking off from pad 39A at Cape Canaveral, Florida\u2014the same pad that the Apollo astronauts left from. This is because that pad was built to be absurdly large since they didn\u2019t know yet how big a rocket they\u2019d be using. When you get there, you head up the tower and across the bridge into the Big Fucking Spaceship.\n\n2) Take off. You strap in, and the BFR lifts off. After a few minutes, the first-stage BFB separates and heads back down to Earth. The BFS that you\u2019re in continues onward and settles into Earth\u2019s orbit.\n\n3) Refuel in orbit. After landing back on Earth, the BFB is capped with a new BFS\u2014this one full of propellant (liquid oxygen and methane).6 It lifts off again and pings the propellant-filled spaceship into orbit, where it rendezvouses7 with your spaceship. The two connect like two orcas holding hands as the propellant is transferred.\n\nThis happens a few more times until your spaceship is entirely refueled.8 This process is critical A) for lowering the cost of the trip, and B) for making the trip much faster. People have always thought a journey to Mars would take six or nine months, but the BFS will get there in three.\n4) Head to Mars. Three months of fun times in microgravity and getting really sick of the other people on the ship.9 During the journey, the spaceship steers using cold gas thrusters, powered by huge solar arrays:\n\n5) Enter the Mars atmosphere. Time for the heat shield to be in the shit:\n\n6) Land on Mars. Upright, the same way the first stage lands on Earth.\n7) Live on Mars for a while doing god knows what. If it\u2019s early on in the colonization process, you\u2019re probably there to work and help build up the initial industries. Later on, it could be anything\u2014research, entrepreneurship, or just simply adventure.\n8) Make propellant on Mars. This will be one of the key early industries to set up on Mars. Propellant consists of liquid oxygen (O2) and methane (CH4), which are both conveniently easy to make from the massive quantities of H2O (ice) and CO2 (the main gas in the Martian atmosphere) already sitting on Mars. They\u2019ll use this propellant to load up the spaceship you came there on in preparation for its voyage back to Earth. Doing this spares the massive expense of having to carry propellant all the way from Earth for the return trip.\n9) Either stay forever or come back. If you come back, you\u2019ll do so by boarding one of the BFS\u2019s that came over in the last batch.\n10) Land vertically on Earth. Just like you did on Mars. The spaceship will go through routine maintenance in preparation to head back to Mars two years later.\n11) Be that insufferable person who can\u2019t be part of any conversation without figuring out some way to bring up your time on Mars. \nMission complete.\nThis kind-of-confusing diagram sums it up:\n\nAnd this video sums it up very deliciously:\n\nSo that\u2019s the deal with the Big Fucking Rocket and how it\u2019ll all work.10\nNow let\u2019s talk about how this all might play out.\nThe Plan\nBack to reality. So how do we get from, \u201cthere\u2019s this rad potential rocket that might be ready to launch in five years\u201d to \u201cwe\u2019re a thriving multi-planetary civilization with a million people on Mars\u201d?\n10,000 flights. That\u2019s how many BFS trips to Mars Elon thinks it\u2019ll take to bring the Mars population to a million.\nWhy 10,000? Because there will be at least 100 people on most trips, and that number will go up over time\u2014but there will also be some people coming back from Mars each time other people go. In the lower part of each BFS will be a huge cargo compartment. Elon thinks we\u2019ll need to get at least 10 million tons of cargo to Mars for the million-person colony to become self-sustaining, which will happen in a little over 10,000 flights if SpaceX can get the cargo payload capacity up to 1,000 tons relatively quickly, as they hope to.\nAnd when will these 10,000 trips start?\nWell let\u2019s take a look at the Mars-Earth Synodic calendar\u2014which deals with the dates when Earth and Mars are closest to each other (called a \u201cMars opposition\u201d). Earth\u2019s orbit is smaller than Mars\u2019s, so Earth goes around the sun quicker\u2014so much so that every 26 months, Earth laps Mars and they\u2019re briefly next to each other. That\u2019s the one time when Earth-Mars transfers can happen.\nWe\u2019re currently pretty close to Mars, since the last Mars opposition happened on May 22, 2016. That\u2019s why, if you happen to be an \u201coh shit there\u2019s a way-too-bright star let me take out my Sky Guide app and figure out which planet that is and then tell everyone I\u2019m with and find that, yet again, no one cares, because everyone is a horrible person\u201d nerd like me, you know that all summer, Mars has been super prominent and bright in our night sky.11 A year from now, Mars will be on the other side of the sun from us, and we won\u2019t see it in our night sky at all.\nThe 2016 Earth-Mars opposition is also a special one, because it\u2019s the last time it\u2019ll happen without anybody talking about it.\nWhy? Because starting with the next one in July of 2018, SpaceX will start sending stuff to Mars each time there\u2019s an opposition, and this will become increasingly big news each time. Here\u2019s the tentative schedule, if everything goes perfectly to plan:\nUpcoming Mars Oppositions \u2013 and what SpaceX is planning for each\nJuly, 2018: Send a Dragon spacecraft (the Falcon 9\u2019s SUV-size spacecraft) to Mars with cargo\nOctober, 2020: Send multiple Dragons with more cargo\nDecember, 2022: Maiden BFS voyage to Mars. Carrying only cargo. This is the spaceship Elon wants to call Heart of Gold.\nJanuary, 2025: First people-carrying BFS voyage to Mars.\nLet\u2019s all go back and read that last line again.\nJanuary, 2025: First people-carrying BFS voyage to Mars.\nDid you catch that?\nIf things go to plan, the Neil Armstrong of Mars will touch down about eight years from now.\nAnd zero people are talking about it.\nBut they will be. The hype will start a couple years from now when the Dragons make their Mars trips, and it\u2019ll kick into high gear in 2022 when the Big Fucking Spaceship finally launches and heads to Mars and lands there. Everyone will be talking about this.\nAnd the buzz will just accelerate from there as the first group of BFS astronauts are announced and become household names, admired for their bravery, because everyone will know there\u2019s a reasonable chance something goes wrong and they don\u2019t make it back alive. Then, in 2024 they\u2019ll take off on a three-month trip that\u2019ll be front-page news every day. When they land, everyone on Earth will be watching. It\u2019ll be 1969 all over again.\nThis is a thing that\u2019s happening.\nElon doesn\u2019t like when people ask him about this first voyage and the Neil Armstrong of Mars. He says that it\u2019s not about humanity putting a new multi-planetary feather in its cap, and he\u2019s quick to point out, \u201cputting people on the moon was super exciting\u2014but where\u2019s our moon base?\u201d In other words, having humanity give Mars a high five for bragging rights is not what matters\u2014what matters is carrying out the full vision of actually creating a full, self-sustaining civilization on Mars.\nAnd yeah, sure, fine. But I\u2019m excited for 2025. It\u2019s gonna be so fun.\nAnyway, so then the next Mars opposition will roll around in 2027. This time, if everything stays on track, multiple BFS\u2019s will make the trek to Mars, carrying more people than were in the original group in 2025. And the spaceship that went over in 2025\u2014the space Mayflower\u2014will make its return trip to Earth, carrying some of the first group of Mars pioneers back home. They\u2019ll return to massive celebration as international heroes, and the legendary spaceship will head off to enjoy its life in the Air and Space Museum.\nMeanwhile, we\u2019ll all be glued to the TV12 as the group of BFS\u2019s arrive on Mars, where the people in them will continue the grueling work started by the 2025 group. The early colonists will have a hard job like early colonists always do\u2014and this will be extra hard. Not only will they have to truly start from scratch\u2014digging mines and quarries and refineries, constructing the first underground village habitat with the first Martian hospitals and schools and greenhouse farms, laying down a giant plumbing system to pump water into the village, building that first rocket propellant plant\u2014but they\u2019ll have to do all of this in a place where they can\u2019t go outside without a spacesuit on, and where everyone and everything they\u2019ve ever known is on a pale blue dot in the night sky.\nIt\u2019ll be hard, but for the explorers of our world the payoff may be worth it. Elon says: \u201cYou can go anywhere on Earth in 24 hours. There\u2019s no physical frontier on Earth anymore. Now, space is that frontier, so it\u2019ll appeal to anyone with that exploratory spirit.\u201d\nIn April of 2029, SpaceX will send an even larger group of spacecraft, people, and cargo to Mars. This time, it\u2019ll probably get less attention. By 2029, we\u2019ll probably be getting used to the idea that there are people on Mars and that every 26 months, a great two-way migration occurs.\nThe growing Mars colony will continue to entice the adventurers\u2014those who read about the great sailing exhibitions of the 15th and 16th centuries and yearn to be there. When I asked Elon about how the small colony will grow and evolve, he said: \u201cThink of the Mars colony as an organism that starts off as a zygote, and then becomes multi-cellular, and then gets organ differentiation\u2014so it doesn\u2019t look exactly the same all the way along, any more than the first settlement in Jamestown wasn\u2019t representative of the United States today. It\u2019ll be the same with Mars\u2014Mars will be the new New World.\u201d\nThe 2031 and 2033 and 2035 oppositions will bring substantially more people to the new New World. By this point, the budding Martian city will be a part of our lives. We\u2019ll follow the Twitter feeds of some of our favorite journalists on Mars to keep up with what\u2019s happening there. We\u2019ll all get hooked on Mars\u2019s first hit reality shows. And some of us will start thinking, \u201cShould I sign up to go to Mars one of these years before I get too old?\u201d\nBy 2050, there will be over a hundred thousand people on Mars. The company your son works for might have a branch there, and he\u2019ll be saying goodbye to a couple co-workers who are about to head to the planet for a 52-month stint. He tells you that he doesn\u2019t want to go because he doesn\u2019t want to take his ninth-grade daughter away from her life and her friends. But he says she\u2019s applying to a program that would bring her to Mars from the ages of 17 to 23 for an urban planning degree. You worry, even though you know it\u2019s irrational. It\u2019s just that you remember the days when going to Mars was risky and dangerous, and some part of you is still uncomfortable with it. And what if she decides not to come back?\nBy 2065, the early days of Mars seem primitive. During the first few Mars migrations, only a few spaceships made the trip with only 100 people in each, it was prohibitively expensive to go, it took three months to get there, and there were only a few very grueling industries on Mars to work in.\nIn 2065, every Mars opposition sees over 1,000 ships make the trip, each carrying over 500 people and a couple thousand tons of cargo. Half a million people make the journey every two years, and about 50,000 less than that come back, because Earth-to-Mars migration capacity grows a little bit each time as more ships are built. The trip, which now takes only 30 days, costs only $60,000 (in 2016 dollars)\u2014and most people just pay off the ticket price with their well-paying job on Mars (labor is in high demand as the early Mars cities continue to expand and new cities are built).\nMany people remember those early days of the Mars colony when it was all about SpaceX\u2014funded by SpaceX or their cargo clients and driven by their ambition and their ingenuity and their guts. But now, dozens of companies specialize in Earth-Mars transit and hundreds of companies focus on development and entrepreneurship on Mars. And transit is paid for like planes and trains and buses are paid for today\u2014by passengers buying tickets.\nA decade later, the 2074 migration brings the Mars population above a million people. Small celebrations break out around both worlds, as a long-awaited landmark is achieved. Most people though, don\u2019t even notice.\n___________\nEverything I just said was based on things Elon said on my phone call with him. Some of it was numbers he said directly\u2014like the last paragraph, which came from him saying, \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that we can get to a million roughly 50 years after the start.\u201d Other times it was me extrapolating a possible future, given the predictions I heard from him. It\u2019s all based in reality. At least, it\u2019s based in Elon Musk\u2019s best crack at reality. He was very careful to qualify everything that sounded like a prediction or a projection with, \u201cThis is what might happen if things go well\u2014but there\u2019s no way to know, and many things could go wrong along the way.\u201d He emphasized that \u201cit\u2019s not that SpaceX has all the answers and we\u2019ve got it covered or anything like that\u2014it\u2019s that we want to show that it\u2019s possible. But it\u2019s far from a given.\u201d As for things that could go wrong, he listed off a few (like World War III), and one of his biggest concerns is that if he somehow dies young, SpaceX could be taken over by someone who wants to milk the company for profit instead of staying single-mindedly focused on the Mars civilization mission.\nBut if SpaceX can manage to get this thing started, Elon thinks it could be not just a big deal in itself, it could jumpstart a slew of new possibilities for humanity. He explains:\nThe big picture isn\u2019t just to back up the hard drive but to really change humanity into a multi-planetary species. Essentially what we\u2019re saying is we\u2019re establishing a regular cargo route to Mars. With the economic forcing function of interplanetary commerce, there will be the resources and the incentive to massively improve space transport technology, and I think then things really go to a whole new level. \nWhat I\u2019m describing may sound really crazy, but it actually will be a small fraction of what is ultimately done, as long as we become a two-planet civilization. Look at shipping technology in Europe. When all you had to do was cross the Mediterranean, the ships were pretty lame\u2014they couldn\u2019t cross the Atlantic. So commerce basically had short-range vessels. Without the forcing function, shipping technology didn\u2019t improve that much\u2014you could do the same things with ships, pretty much, around the time of Julius Caesar as you could around the time of Columbus. 1,500 years later, you could still just cross the Mediterranean. But as soon as there was a reason to cross the Atlantic, shipping technology improved dramatically. There needed to be the American colonies in order for that to happen.\nThe people at SpaceX believe that once we\u2019re on Mars, the rest of the Solar System becomes accessible as well. That\u2019s why they didn\u2019t just create images of their Big Fucking Rocket standing proudly on Mars. They showed it flying by Jupiter.\n\nAnd Saturn.\n\nAnd bringing human explorers to faraway moons.\n\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a time when any person can go anywhere they want in our vast Solar System\u2014a new golden age for exploration, with uncharted physical frontiers in every direction.\n\n_______\n\nIf you like Wait But Why, sign up for our email list and we\u2019ll send you new posts when they come out.\nTo support Wait But Why, visit our Patreon page.\n_________\nHere\u2019s the whole WBW Elon Musk series:\nPart 1, on Elon: Elon Musk Series: IntroductionPart 2, on Tesla: How Tesla Will Change the World Part 3, on SpaceX: How (and Why) SpaceX Will Colonize MarsPart 4, on the thing that makes Elon so effective: The Chef and the Cook: Musk\u2019s Secret Sauce\nExtra Post #1: The Deal With Solar CityExtra Post #2: The Deal With the Hyperloop\nSix other Wait But Why explainers:\nThe American Presidents\u2014Washington to Lincoln\nFrom Muhammad to ISIS: Iraq\u2019s Full Story\nThe AI Revolution: Road to Superintelligence\nThe Fermi Paradox: Where are all the aliens?\nHow Cryonics Works (and Why it Makes Sense)\nHow to Name a BabyThis is a Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy reference. In the book, Heart of Gold was \u201cthe first spacecraft to make use of the Infinite Improbability.\u201d Elon likes the name because he thinks SpaceX\u2019s path was highly improbable.\u21a9To be clear, payload is what the rocket can actually bring to space. Thrust is what the engines can push to space, which has to include both the entire BFR and its contained payload. Almost all of a rocket\u2019s thrust is used to lift the rocket itself, with only a small fraction of it allotted for the payload. When I talk about thrust in these posts and say how many cars a set of engines could push to space, I\u2019m talking about a hypothetical scenario in which there is no rocket, just the rocket\u2019s engines with a platform on top of them and cars stacked on top of the platform.\u21a9Here\u2019s a video of Raptor\u2019s first test firing, which happened a few days ago. It would be so unfun to put your hand through that column of flame.\u21a9I asked Elon why there were 42 smaller-sized engines instead of a smaller number of huge ones, and he said that they had imagined larger engines at one point but that \u201coptimization seems to call for more small engines, not fewer big engines.\u201d I can\u2019t explain more than that because I don\u2019t get it.\u21a9We often think of floating astronauts as being in \u201czero gravity.\u201d In fact, they\u2019re very much inside of the Earth\u2019s gravity well when they\u2019re floating\u2014they\u2019re just orbiting around the Earth so fast that they\u2019re in constant free fall. The effect is the same\u2014they float\u2014but since they\u2019re not actually in zero gravity, we call it microgravity.\u21a9The methane part of that is a big innovation. Other rockets, including the Falcons, use kerosene as the primary fuel\u2014but for a bunch of reasons, methane seems to make more sense for a Mars trip.\u21a9Upsettingly-spelled word.\u21a9Elon says that this is the plan if the refueling process is quick, like a couple weeks or less. If it takes a lot longer, then the spacecraft will be launched first without people, and then whenever it\u2019s all refueled and ready to go, a spacecraft carrying just people will be launched and it will deliver the crew to the spacecraft for an Earth orbit rendezvous.\u21a9People like to bring up the dangers of space radiation during this time. Elon thinks the dangers are overstated, and that with proper precautions (like a protective layer of water around the crew cabin), the radiation harm to a crew member would be similar to the damage to your body if you were to become a smoker during those three months and then stop. Not ideal, but not too big a deal.\u21a9In the presentation, Elon went off on a tangent at one point that delighted me. He talked about the possibility of the BFR\u2019s spaceship doubling as a super-fast way to transport stuff or people around the Earth: \u201cIt actually has enough capability that you could maybe even go to orbit with the spaceship\u2026and maybe there is some market for really fast transport of stuff around the world\u2026We could transport cargo to anywhere on Earth in 45 minutes at the longest\u2014most would be maybe 20, 25 minutes. So maybe if we had a floating platform off the coast of New York, you could go from New York to Tokyo in 25 minutes. You could cross the Atlantic in 10 minutes. Most of your time would be getting to the ship, and then it would be real quick after that. There are some intriguing possibilities there, but we\u2019re not counting on that.\u201d YES. Amazing glimpse of the world of the future, when someone will text you from Delhi and ask if you want to zip over from San Francisco to grab lunch, and you\u2019ll say, \u201cSure, but I have a meeting in two hours, so I can\u2019t stay long.\u201d Except you won\u2019t, because you\u2019ll just meet your friend virtually and it\u2019ll feel exactly how it would to be there in person. So there goes that.\u21a9Right next to Mars all summer has been a pretty bright Saturn\u2014something I\u2019ve also told a bunch of people who don\u2019t care.\u21a9or whatever 2027 humans are glued to when they\u2019re glued to something\u21a9All images are from spacex.com, unless they have \u201cwaitbutwhy.com\u201d written at the bottom, in which case they were made by

Some people go on a date, and then another date, and then another, and one day it\u2019s just clear to both of them that they\u2019re in a relationship. Some people start seeing each other, but they keep things black and white until a \u201cSo are we doing this?\u201d conversation makes it official. Sometimes a platonic friendship forms first and tension builds under the surface until an unexpected kiss lights the friendship on fire.\nBut there\u2019s usually some first time that this happens:\n\nAnd suddenly, you\u2019re here:\n\nYour new relationship is with you all the time, even when you\u2019re not together.\n\nYou\u2019ve left the rest of shitty humanity behind, and it feels great. Then this happens:\n\n\nAnd all the song lyrics make sense.\nIt goes on like this for a while, but as the months pass, you notice things changing. The unicorns turn into horses and then bikes and then one day, you\u2019re not riding anything at all. The perfect person you found starts to say and do imperfect things. Some of those funny quirks you adored early on seem to be striking you as more annoying than funny. And it starts to dawn on you that you might be dating a fucking dick.\n\nSometimes things go further south, as butterflies and rainbows turn into frustration and disillusionment, and the relationship that used to lift you up seems to now be boxing you in.\n\nAll of the negative qualities you couldn\u2019t see in the fog of love are suddenly right in your face, like a weight that\u2019s dragging you down.\n\nA lot of relationships end right about here.\nBut maybe, having seen the dark side of your partner, you step back and take a long look at both the good and bad together. You put away both the rose-colored glasses and the shit-colored glasses and see who you\u2019re really dating: a three-dimensional, one-of-a-kind, beautiful, piece-of-shit human being.\nWho\u2019s the best.\n\nAnd the worst.\n\nAnd your teammate.\n\nAnd your rock.\n\nAnd you decide you like what you\u2019ve got.\nAnd your lives go on together.\n\nBut just when things get simple, something else starts to happen:\n\n\n\nSociety, in most parts of the world, doesn\u2019t like when a relationship lasts too long. To society, a relationship is simply a testing ground\u2014an incubator that prepares you for The Decision. And if too many years go by in a relationship without The Decision being made, society decides that something must be wrong. To help right the wrong, society will begin to apply pressure on the couple, from all angles.\nSome people are bigger than society. Most of us are not. For most of us, society\u2019s rules are our rules, and as you and your person walk down your blue balance beam, you can feel the walking space melt away around you. It\u2019s time to make The Decision.\nYour relationship needs to be converted into Everything Forever or Nothing Ever Again. Soon.\nThe typical human isn\u2019t really equipped to make The Decision. We evolved to live short lives, during which life-altering 60-year commitments weren\u2019t a thing. We evolved in small communities without nearly as many available options. And most of us, when presented with The Decision, have relatively little relationship experience and an incomplete understanding of our own adult selves\u2014selves that in many cases only recently started existing.\nBut society doesn\u2019t care. So you decide.\nHumans have come up with four main methods to make The Decision:\nMethod 1) Let the other person decide\nThe easiest way to handle The Decision is to just not really handle it. You take a passive approach, as if you\u2019re on a raft, going down a river, and you have no control over where the current leads you\u2014you\u2019re in the hands of momentum and inertia. Once you hit your mid-20s, you just wait until you get into your next relationship and then marry whoever that person happens to be, whenever/if-ever that person decides it\u2019s time, regardless of how right or wrong the relationship is for you. \nMethod 2) Let your primal forces battle it out\nFor people determined to more actively make The Decision, the next easiest way to go is to let your emotions and primal forces figure it out. Making The Decision provides a reminder that \u201cyou\u201d is actually a collection of voices, each weighing in from different parts of evolutionary history. Each voice has its role in the homeostasis of our normal lives, but when it\u2019s time for something as rare and important as The Decision, there\u2019s suddenly a brawl in your head for influence\u2014and no one brawls harder than your primal forces. Some of the major players:\nLove\nDeep down, most people are sympathetic characters. And when you\u2019re in a relationship for enough time, you\u2019ll usually end up loving the person\u2014even if you don\u2019t like them. You know their whole story, which makes you care about them and the fact that they rely on you makes you feel a tremendous loyalty to them. This is the kind of love you feel for your family and closest friends, and it can exist in full force even after the feeling of being \u201cin love\u201d has faded. And for many people, this deep emotional connection makes it basically inconceivable to ever break up with their partner. This is a beautiful way to make The Decision when you\u2019re in a strong, healthy relationship, and a tragedy when you\u2019re not.\nFear\nHumans specialize in making critical life decisions based on fear, and when it comes to The Decision, there\u2019s a lot to be afraid of.\nWhen a fearful person takes a look to the left side of the balance beam, they might see all kinds of things:\n\nThe right side of the beam isn\u2019t much better.\n\nDifferent people feel these fears at different levels of intensity, and for someone whose fear tends to run their life, it\u2019s usually pretty simple: the particular fear that grabs them hardest by the collar ends up making The Decision.\nEgo\nYour ego, meanwhile, is busy staring down at a clipboard. Depending on what your ego values, that clipboard might display a checklist describing your ideal partner\u2014their appearance, age, family background, intelligence, job, wealth, general personality type, etc. Or maybe the clipboard has a story written on it, one that was written long ago about how your life should go. Your ego will examine your current situation and see how it measures up to what\u2019s written on the clipboard, and it\u2019ll base The Decision on its findings.\nWhile all of this analysis is going on, your ego sometimes also finds itself getting very hungry\u2014for admiration, attention, and conquest. If this hunger gets too intense, it can overwhelm an ego to the point where it may sway its vote, no matter what the clipboard says.\nSex Drive\nYour sex drive is not a complicated character. If it has a grilled cheese sandwich every day for lunch and then one day, you ask it if it would like to try the buffet, it\u2019s going to say yes. Unless, of course, the grilled cheese is super fucking incredible.\nSo these four primal forces, along with a few others, all voice their opinion at the same time. In some people, all of the voices are in agreement about the verdict. In others, the voices disagree, but one of the voices is so loud that it drowns out the others. In both of those cases, The Decision is pretty easy.\nBut what happens when your primal forces provide no clear answer?\nMethod 3) Turn to your gut\nFor some reason, we have wise stomachs, and when The Decision isn\u2019t obvious, sometimes asking your gut can do the trick.\nYour gut relies on your intuition and asks one simple question:\n\nAnd what makes your gut your gut is that when it answers that question, it doesn\u2019t deliberate\u2014it just knows the answer: a simple yes or a simple no. The gut doesn\u2019t deal with nuance, which makes it a good match for something big and binary, like The Decision.\nAnd for a lot of people, this works.\nBut there are some people who won\u2019t end up being passive Deciders, or emotional Deciders, or gut Deciders\u2014who won\u2019t turn to any primal or instinctual voice when it comes to this particular decision. They\u2019ll get to the bottom of this in spite of those voices\u2014based on experience and evidence and data and facts. They won\u2019t be instinct-driven or fear-driven or ego-driven or sex-driven\u2014they\u2019ll be guided by rationality.\nThe brain Deciders.\nAnd when it comes time for them to make The Decision, they\u2019re in big trouble.\nMethod 4) Figure it out in your brain\nThe prefrontal cortex is kind of like the brain\u2019s brain. It\u2019s the part of you that sorts through information and makes plans and predictions and weighs evidence. It\u2019s great at using what it learns to draw conclusions about how to act or what to do\u2014as long as it knows the rules of the game and has access to the right information. And when it\u2019s time for The Decision, your brain will do what it always does when confronted by a fork in the road\u2014it\u2019ll attempt to think and assess and analyze its way to the optimal rational answer.\nSomething as important and permanent as The Decision requires conviction, and conviction requires a source. No source of conviction, no Decision.\nThe source of the heart\u2019s conviction is its love and care for the other person. The source of the ego\u2019s conviction is its belief in its clipboard. Fear and sex drive derive their conviction from the obvious\u2014fear and sex. The source of the gut\u2019s conviction is an instinctive feeling that emerges from experience. And an inertia-y person gets their conviction from the conviction of someone else. Those sources are what allow people to make The Decision with relative ease.\nThe brain hears these voices, but it discredits their conviction in each case because the certainty emerges from what the brain sees as an irrational place. For the brain, the only respectable source of conviction is sound evidence.\nAnd good luck with that.\nIf you\u2019re typically a brain person, when it comes to The Decision, you want to try to not be you. Because the brain, for all its merits, does not do well in this situation, where the outcome is critical and evidence is hard to come by. Let\u2019s look at how it might go:\nMaybe you start by looking over to the marriage side of the balance beam\u2014where you see a house.\n\nThat\u2019s the house of the life you\u2019re about to sign up for. You really enjoy your relationship, so you\u2019re excited about what might be inside that house. But the house is also mysterious, because you don\u2019t really know what either you or your partner will be like as a spouse or how either of you will grow or change in the future. Not much concrete evidence there.\nSo you turn and look over at the breakup side of the beam. You see a path, and a couple walking down it.\n\nThat road is whatever life you\u2019d end up living if you were to move on from your relationship, and that\u2019s the marriage you\u2019d end up in. The marriage that might have been.\nWhat kind of marriage would that be, and what adventures lie down that road? Maybe your life on that road would be much happier than whatever\u2019s in that house on the other side, and maybe your current partner would end up happier somewhere else too. Or maybe you\u2019d look back and realize that you made the biggest mistake of your life. Without knowing anything about that other path, there\u2019s no way to compare it to the house on the other side. Again, no real evidence.\nSo you take a closer look at the one thing you have actual information about: your current relationship.\nYou decide to make a big chart where you list all the things you like and don\u2019t like about your relationship\u2014a relationship-assessment chart. You end up here:\n\nFucking great\u2014now what? All relationships\u2014the good ones and the bad ones\u2014have a chart that looks like that, with things in all four of those zones: blue, green, yellow, and red. And without much relationship experience or marriage expertise, you have no good way to evaluate whether your particular diagram looks as promising as you hope it does or whether there are red flags in it that you\u2019re not seeing that will lead to major issues later. You try comparing your relationship to those that your friends are in\u2014but it\u2019s hard to know what really goes on in other relationships, and each one is so complicated and unique anyway that it\u2019s mostly apples and oranges.\nWithout any way to construct an airtight argument in either direction, you\u2019re left feeling very little conviction about the situation. Because the stakes are so high, you become paranoid about making the wrong choice, and every time you think you might have an answer, you second-guess yourself.\nThe whole thing quickly becomes a mindfuck. You try talking yourself into feeling good about marriage by reminding yourself that every relationship has flaws and that marriage is all about acceptance\u2014but then you realize that that\u2019s also exactly how someone sounds when they\u2019re talking themselves into settling for the wrong person. In both of those cases, the green and red zones of the diagram provide more than enough material to construct a full \u201cwhy this is a great decision\u201d argument. Likewise, if you wanted to play devil\u2019s advocate and look at the reasons this might not be the right marriage for you, the blue and yellow sections of the diagram would make it easy\u2014whether breaking up is a wise move or a foolish one.\nAnd because the diagram and its four zones allow you to so effortlessly construct whatever convincing narrative you want to about your relationship and The Decision, you worry that anything that feels like conviction is just you falling for a narrative created by fear or ego or some other deep-down motivation.\nUnable to come to a trustworthy conclusion, the brain person becomes a Paralyzed Pre-Marriage Relationship Person. A PPMRP has three options:\n1) Procrastinate. Until you die, until your partner dies, or until your partner breaks up with you.\n2) Turn back around and succumb to one of the primal forces. Maybe if you wait for a while, your fear of being single at 36 will overpower your dedication to rationality?\n3) Come up with a decision-making litmus test that actually works.\nAssuming you don\u2019t find the first two options ideal, let\u2019s talk about litmus tests.\nThe \u201cactually works\u201d part of option 3 is important, because people often come up with decision-making litmus tests that don\u2019t actually tell you anything. For example:\nAn overly-broad, one-size-fits-all litmus test is a bad litmus test. \nLike, \u201cIf I\u2019m still toiling over this three years in, that\u2019s probably a sign this isn\u2019t the right thing for me.\u201d Or, \u201cI\u2019m sure if we\u2019ve been together this long, there\u2019s a good reason for that.\u201d Or, \u201cIf I still have the desire to sleep with other people, it must mean my heart\u2019s not in this.\u201d\nLitmus tests like those suggest that everyone who toils over the marriage decision should break up or that every couple who\u2019s together for a long time should get married or that no one in a great relationship still wants to sleep with other people. Different people do things like toil or stay together or feel promiscuous\u2014or 100 other things\u2014for totally different reasons, so broad statements like those don\u2019t help with anything.\nA litmus test that always yields the answer \u201cWe should get married\u201d is a bad litmus test. \nLike, \u201cWhen I picture them standing on the altar with someone else, it\u2019s a horrible thought\u2014that must mean it\u2019s the right move to marry them.\u201d Or, \u201cWhen we broke up for three days last month, I missed them unbearably\u2014and it told me all I need to know.\u201d Or, \u201cI care about them more than anything and really want the best for them\u2014that\u2019s how I know I want to be with them.\u201d\nAll these litmus tests tell you is that you A) feel possessive, B) feel attached, and C) love the person. In most long relationships\u2014good and bad\u2014the people in them feel all three of these things. The only real information you learn with tests like these is that you are, in fact, in a relationship.\nA litmus test that always yields the answer \u201cWe should break up\u201d is a bad litmus test.\nAny version of the question, \u201cIs this person a great match for me in every important way?\u201d or \u201cIs this person the best person for me?\u201d\nNo, the person isn\u2019t a great match for you in every important way. That has never happened before in our species. Likewise, there are at least a few hundred million people in the world that match your sexual preference. Only one of them is the best possible person for you. The chances that you were ever in the same square mile as that person are tiny, and the chances that you\u2019re currently dating them are you\u2019re not currently dating them. Litmus tests like these either require you to have a delusional view of your partner or the world, or they\u2019re pretty much guaranteed to yield the conclusion that you need to break up and continue your quest for The One.\nPeople struggling with The Decision crave guidance, and while statements like all of these can feel like a rescue line out of the PPMRP quagmire in the form of some larger wisdom, they don\u2019t actually tell you anything about what you should do.\nA good system for tortured brain people\nI\u2019m not an expert on this, nor am I married\u2014but I\u2019ve read a lot about it, and I\u2019ve had a front row seat for a large handful of case studies, watching friends go through The Decision and talking to them about it while it was happening. And I think if we just use common sense, we can probably figure out what a hopeless brain person can do in this situation\u2014so let\u2019s give it a try.\nTo me, a good system might be as simple as these two steps:\nStep 1) Find out where your gut is leaning, using thought experiments.\nThe gut is a real thing. And for our purposes here, your gut is the little kid in you who just wants one outcome more than the other.\nThe problem for brain people is that they\u2019re by definition not gut people. The gut draws its wisdom from a mysterious place the prefrontal cortex does not understand, which makes brain people suspicious of the gut\u2019s conclusions.\nAnd suspicion is fine here, since your gut\u2019s wisdom is limited by your experience and guts are often proven wrong with time\u2014but the gut\u2019s opinion is still important information.\nGut people have good practice at communicating with their gut about important decisions. Brain people do not\u2014and the usual gut question\u2014\u201ddoes this feel right?\u201d\u2014won\u2019t work. So we need to use thought experiments to isolate the gut\u2019s voice amongst the cacophony in your head. Exercises like these are best designed by you, for you, since only you know you. But here are some ideas:\nOne kind of thought experiment creates a simulation in your head, which acts like a fishing fly, and our goal is to try to get the gut to be fooled by the simulation for a moment and jump at the bait, revealing what it really wants.\nSomething like: \u201cImagine you were being arranged married by the town matchmaker and she handed you an envelope with your to-be spouse\u2019s name written inside. You open the envelope and it\u2019s the name of your current partner.\u201d This image might just make your gut jump up for a second and say, \u201cPhew!\u201d Or maybe instead, it would deflate just a little, just for a moment. If either happens, that\u2019s good information.\nAnother type of thought experiment tries to get at the general yes or no feeling the question \u201cdoes this feel right?\u201d is supposed to reveal, but with some real on-the-nose imagery.\nLike: \u201cPicture two gravestones next to each other\u2014yours and your partners. Does that feel right?\u201d\nSome of the most telling thought experiments help hear what the gut\u2019s saying by trying to remove the often deafening voice of fear from the question and seeing if that changes anything.\nFor example, to test whether a resistance to breaking up is just a dread of the actual breakup itself, you could ask: \u201cIf there were a big green button in front of me that, if pressed, would make me fully single, where everything has been worked out with getting our things from each other\u2019s apartments, where everyone in my life already knows, and where I\u2019m totally emotionally recovered and moving on\u2014in fact, I have a date tonight\u2014would I press the button?\u201d\nOr if the real fear is of being single for years and years and never finding a new relationship, the button could do all of those things but also include \u201cand I\u2019m immersed in a new relationship.\u201d\nA fear of eternal commitment could be sussed out with a question like, \u201cWhat if The Decision weren\u2019t between breaking up and marriage, but only between breaking up and committing to the relationship for the next five years?\u201d\nIf thought exercises like these leave you with the feeling that your inner inner self is \u201cpulling\u201d for the relationship, that\u2019s promising.\nBut it\u2019s not enough.\nStep 2) Figure out what your deal-breakers are.\nLet\u2019s bring back our relationship assessment chart:\n\nAs we established earlier, this chart doesn\u2019t provide much insight into how The Decision should go, because almost every relationship\u2014the good and the bad, the healthy and the harmful, those built to last and those doomed to fail\u2014has a chart like this, where it checks some of the right boxes and some of the wrong boxes, and also misses some of each. And yet, certain charts map out happy couples and others do not. So what\u2019s the difference?\nDeal-breakers.\nEven though these charts show that there are many, many things we want from a relationship, our ability to be happy only depends on a small percentage of them.\nOur relationship chart is like a happiness puzzle, and the items in the green and yellow zones are the pieces. The right question to ask about the chart isn\u2019t, \u201cIs this perfect for me?\u201d or, \u201cWill I automatically be happy if this is my chart?\u201d The right question is, \u201cHow can I work with these pieces to figure out how to make myself and my partner happy?\u201d If you\u2019re a good puzzler, with some work and compromise\u2014i.e. some adultness\u2014you\u2019ll probably be able to figure it out.\nUnless the chart is missing one of your deal-breakers.\nYour deal-breakers are the things that, if not part of your relationship, will guarantee your unhappiness. They\u2019re things that no amount of hard work or compromise or maturity can fix. Your must-haves\u2014and your must-not-haves.\nA deal-breaker usually comes in the format:\nThere\u2019s no way I can figure out how to be happy with someone who is / isn\u2019t  ____.\nThere\u2019s no way I can figure out how to be happy with someone who does / doesn\u2019t ____.\nThere\u2019s no way I can figure out how to be happy with someone who values / doesn\u2019t value  ____.\nThere\u2019s no way I can figure out how to be happy with someone who treats me / doesn\u2019t treat me ____.\nThere\u2019s no way I can figure out how to be happy with someone who believes / doesn\u2019t believe  ____.\nOr maybe:\nOut of principle, I will only be with / will not be with someone who ____.\nMost real deal-breakers will be broad\u2014e.g. \u201cI may be able to fall in love with a negative person, but I could never be happy with that person.\u201d Or, \u201cI will never be with someone who makes my self-esteem lower.\u201d Or, \u201cI could never be happy with someone who isn\u2019t intellectually curious.\u201d Or something clean-cut like, \u201cI could never be happy with someone who refused to have children.\u201d\nDeal-breakers that are more specific in nature can in some cases make sense\u2014maybe you love dogs so much that it would truly impede you from being a happy person if you ended up with someone who didn\u2019t want to own a dog\u2014but they should be rare.\nThe key with all of these is that there are very few. These aren\u2019t wants\u2014these are needs. Your wants are important, but remember, the only people even eligible for the deal-breaker test are those who have already passed the gut test\u2014plenty of your wants have already been taken care of in step 1 of our system.\nKnowing your deal-breakers can help you know the right relationship when you see it, but it can also go a long way for anyone already in a relationship, because it lends insight into one of the trickiest aspects of a relationship: compromise. A great way to be unhappy is to refuse to compromise on things you wish were true about your relationship that aren\u2019t. But another great way to be unhappy is to be too willing to compromise on your deal-breakers. That\u2019s why this is so important\u2014deal-breakers not only help Deciders and single people figure out what should be unacceptable in a relationship, they also remind already-Decided people that most of the problems in their relationship are probably non-deal-breakers that it\u2019s okay to chill out about. Because so many relationship problems boil down to one or both members treating non-deal-breakers like deal-breakers\u2014or vice versa.\nAnd that\u2019s really it. This gut check / deal-breakers system suggests that the mindfuck of The Decision is actually pretty simple\u2014if a relationship successfully makes it through both steps 1 and 2, get married. If it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t.\nAt least that\u2019s what the system says.\nBut who knows. Relationships are impossibly complicated. And making a black-and-white binary decision about something that\u2019s anything but black-and-white is kind of an insane thing to do.\nAnd of course, even if it\u2019s the right system, it\u2019s not actually easy because assessing step 1 and step 2 isn\u2019t easy. Getting a reading from your gut that you can trust is no small task for someone who typically lives in their brain\u2014and figuring out what your deal-breakers are requires a serious deep-dive into your soul.\nBut for now, at least it\u2019s a system\u2014and a system you can hang on to. Which is just what some of us need.\n\n___________\nIf you liked this:\nAnother Wait But Why deep dive into the quandaries of figuring out who to marry: How to Pick a Life Partner\nSome further

Using what we learned from the surveys, our team spent a large part of the summer strategically matchmaking groups of people together and creating customized activities to fit each group.\nThen, on Saturday, it all happened at once\u2014over 3,500 people participated in over 400 events that took place in 168 cities, in these 48 countries:\n\nAnd Sunday was big group day, with large picnic gatherings in cities all over the world.\nIt was exciting:\n\nAnd a lot happened.\nLike this dinner in Germany:\n\nOr this one in Portugal:\n\nOr this one in Singapore:\n\nAnd the US:\n\nAnd Austria:\n\nCanada:\n\nEstonia:\n\nHong Kong:\n\nRussia:\n\nIndia:\n\nNew Zealand:\n\nBelgium:\n\nSouth Africa:\n\nAnd the Czech Republic:\n\nPeople picnicked in Paris:\n\n\nAnd Los Angeles:\n\nAnd Amsterdam:\n\nPainted graffiti in London:\n\nGot a lesson on blockchain in Chicago:\n\nLooked through telescopes in Berlin:\n\nExchanged gifts in Moscow:\n\nPlayed Shuffleboard in Brooklyn:\n\nMini golf in San Francisco:\n\nAnd escaped the room in Lagos:\n\nThere were big groups:\n\nThere were small groups:\n\nPeople met at the beach:\n\nAt the pool:\n\nAt the river:\n\nAt the lake:\n\nOn the rocks:\n\nIn the park:\n\nAnd on the street:\n\nThey went to the Louvre:\n\nThe Museum of Natural History:\n\nThe Cabinets of Consequence Exhibition:\n\nAnd the dinosaur museum:\n\nSome people went to restaurants:\n\n\n\n\nOther people\u2014over 50\u2014went on blind dates. (But people don\u2019t tend to be into having a picture of them on a date posted on the internet so we\u2019ll leave it at that.)\nA bunch of people hosted hangouts in their homes. All over their homes. Like in the living room:\n\nOn the terrace:\n\nAround the counter:\n\nOn the deck:\n\nIn the kitchen:\n\nOn the patio:\n\nIn the backyard:\n\nIn the playroom:\n\nOn the roof:\n\nEven in the treehouse:\n\nEmpty tables turned into full tables:\n\n\nAnd then came dinner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDessert:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd drinks. Like tea:\n\nAnd liquor:\n\nBar beer:\n\nBrewery beer:\n\nStreet beer:\n\nHomemade beer:\n\nAnd boot beer:\n\nThere were Denver dogs:\n\nAnd Cluj-Napoca cats:\n\nThere were lights in Japan:\n\nAnd there was darkness in San Francisco:\n\nThere was snuggling:\n\nThere were rides:\n\nAnd lots of games:\n\n\n\n\nThere was yodeling:\n\n\n\n\n5 strangers, some yodelling and a shit ton of beer. Meeting strangers off the internet doesn\u2019t always involve involuntary organ donation #london #waitbuthi\nA video posted by Ellie Rofe (@ellierofe) on Aug 16, 2016 at 10:36am PDT\n\n\n\n\nand Ws:\n\nAnd neighbors who were sick of your heady shit:\n\nWe made a few rules for everyone. One rule was that no one could talk or ask about anyone\u2019s job for the first hour of the night.\n\nSo people learned about each other in other ways. Like guessing which fun fact about their life was written by which person:\n\nOr explaining why a certain random object defines you:\n\nOr making a plan for if a shark ever bites you:\n\nAnother rule was that people had to bring a king of spades card to help identify each other. So there were kings:\n\n\n\nLots of kings.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we asked each group to make a stick drawing about their night. We didn\u2019t specify much more than that\u2014so things varied. A lot of groups drew the scene:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOthers depicted the characters involved:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were team efforts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#waitbuthi #hyperlapse\nA video posted by Phil Whitehouse (@casablanca) on Aug 13, 2016 at 4:07am PDT\n\n\n\n\nAnd solo projects:\n\nThere were artists:\n\nThere were not artists:\n\nThere were bikes:\n\nThere were lobsters:\n\nSome went artsy:\n\n\nSome went Wait But Why-y:\n\n\nAnd some blew my mind:\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Karen Winter (@kaiwin)\n\n\n\nThere was a Vietnamese tea ceremony in Houston:\n\nA slanty wine bottle in Poland:\n\nAnd Tinder profiles in Hong Kong:\n\nA bunch of groups depicted the great conversation:\n\nAbout all kinds of things:\n\n\n\nThere were thought-provoking questions:\n\nControversial opinions:\n\nAnd pressing debates:\n\nSome drawings revealed that things got weird:\n\n\nAnd apparently some events didn\u2019t go at all as planned. Like when these two militant Red Cross workers forced another attendee to donate blood:\n\nOr when these two chickens morphed into a person:\n\nOr when these six people forced a baby to dump his things in a river:\n\nOr when this happened:\n\nAnd then there were some that are hard to describe. Like these solemn people underneath a large spoon holding a cherry:\n\nOr this zany man:\n\nOr these four psychos:\n\nOr whatever the fuck is happening here:\n\nBut something the drawings did make clear is that a lot can happen in one night with a group of strangers:\n\nWait But Hi turned out to be a lot of things.\nIt was far from perfect. We were only able to set up events for 22% of the 16,000 people who applied. And there were mishaps\u2014which people handled the best they could:\n\n\n\nBut mostly, Wait But Hi was full of good things.\nLike laughter:\n\nFabulous conversation:\n\nUnexpected fun:\n\nAnd amazing strangers:\n\nWho became friends:\n\n\nThe weekend was full of wonderful people:\n\nWho made some souls grow more vibrant:\n\nIt was something like magic:\n\nIt was the internet in your living room:\n\nOr for me and the WBW crew, it was the internet in Central Park:\n\nWhich was a reminder that WBW readers are the best.\nSo thanks for throwing yourselves into our summer experiment\u2014an

Cluey. Let me explain.\nMy father once told me a mundane little anecdote from his youth. It involved his father\u2014my late grandfather\u2014and one of the happiest and most loving people I\u2019ve ever known.\nOne weekend day, my grandfather went to the store and brought a new board game home for the family: Clue.\nHe excitedly asked my father and his sister (who were 7 and 9 at the time) if they wanted to play. They did. They joined him at the kitchen table as he opened up the game, read the instructions and explained to them how to play, divided up the cards and put all the pieces where they go.\nJust as they were about to start, the doorbell rang. It was the neighbor kids, who said they were on their way outside to play some outdoor game they all used to play. Without a second thought, my dad and aunt jumped up from their seats and left with their friends.\nA few hours later, they came back to the house. The game had been put back in the closet.\nAt the time, my dad didn\u2019t think much of it\u2014pretty normal day in their lives. But later on, he found himself remembering that day, and he always felt bad about it. He pictured his father sitting there at the table, now alone, with all the cards and pieces laid out. He pictured him waiting for a little while before accepting that it wasn\u2019t gonna happen today, then collecting all the pieces and cards he had laid out, putting them back in the box, and putting the box back in the closet.\nPretty random story for my dad to tell me, right? The reason he did was because it was part of a conversation where I was trying to articulate a certain thing I suffer from, which is feeling incredibly bad for certain people in certain situations\u2014situations in which the person I feel bad for was probably barely affected by what happened. It\u2019s an odd feeling of intense heartbreaking compassion for people who didn\u2019t actually go through anything especially bad.\nWhen I explained this, my dad said, \u201cI know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d and offered up the Clue story. Devastating. My grandfather had been excited about playing, and he was being such a good, loving dad, and he ended up let down and disappointed. He sat there all by himself with the game board, and finally he put all the cards and pieces back in the box because no, the game wasn\u2019t happening anymore because his kids would rather play with their friends than him. \nMy grandfather fought in World War II. He probably lost friends. He probably shot people. He might have been shot himself, who knows. But the image of him quietly putting all the Clue pieces back in the box? That\u2019s not fucking okay. And now, thanks to my dad sharing this memory, I live every day haunted by this image:\n\nIt\u2019s not just my dad doing this to me. Tell me how I\u2019m supposed to handle this fucking story, where the grandfather made 12 burgers for six grandkids and only one showed up. \nFull Clue situation. And the story includes literally the clueiest picture I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nAs I read the story, I started picturing this NICE FUCKING MAN buying all the ingredients in the grocery store, in a good mood with anticipation for the night, then coming home and making each of the 12 patties by hand\u2014maybe even adding carefully-thought-out spices into them\u2014toasting the buns, and timing everything to be done at just the right time. He even made homemade ice cream. Clue up the dick. It continues, if you imagine what happened at the end of the night. Either he wrapped up eight uneaten burgers, one by one, and put them in the fridge, ensuring that he\u2019s later reminded of the rejection each time he heats one up to eat it, or, even worse, he just threw them in the trash.\nThe only thing that prevented me from taking my own life while reading the story is that the one granddaughter\u2014bless her soul\u2014showed up. Because just imagine.\nAnd then there\u2019s this 89-year-old grandmother, who got dressed nicely and put her paintings up for display at an art showing, and guess what? No one fucking came. Then she packed up her paintings and drove home, feeling \u201cfoolish.\u201d You know what that is? It\u2019s cluey as shit. Especially her choice of the word foolish in particular. I really don\u2019t need this in my life.\nMovies know all about clueyness and use it to their advantage. Remember that super cluey old man neighbor in Home Alone? Who was so nice and lonely and misunderstood? The writers literally invented him to inflict clueyness on the audience so they could then release the burden of that clueyness at the end by showing him in happy reunion with his family. Cheapest trick in the book.\nClueyness doesn\u2019t only apply to old people. One time about five years ago, I was in a shitty mood and in a rush when I hastily walked out of my apartment building. A FedEx man was standing outside the building with his cart of packages, and he wanted to get in so he could leave the packages on top of the communal mailbox (I assume the package recipient wasn\u2019t home, so he had had no luck being buzzed in). As I walked out, he reached for the door as it closed behind me but it shut before he could grab it. After the door re-locked, he let out a frustrated exhale, and then he turned to me and asked, \u201cCan you please open the door so I can drop these off?\u201d I was already 10 steps away though, and late, so I said, \u201cSorry I can\u2019t right now\u201d and turned back towards where I was going. Before I did, I briefly saw his reaction to my refusal to help. He had the face on of a nice person who the world had been mean to all day. The snapshot of that dejected face he made bothered me more and more throughout the day, and now it\u2019s five years later and I still think about it. \nIf someone asks me what my biggest regret is, I have to lie, because how weird would it be if I answered, \u201cThe FedEx man incident. I\u2019m a monster.\u201d\nClueyness is a strange phenomenon. My grandfather probably forgot about the Clue incident an hour after it happened. The FedEx man probably forgot about what I did to him five minutes later. I literally got cluey about a dog the other day, when he was super excited to play and I was busy and nudged him away with my foot and he looked at me confused and taken aback and then went to the side of the room and laid down\u2014and dogs aren\u2019t even real. The weight of my heartache in these cases outweighs the actual tragedy like 10,000:1.\nBut knowing that it\u2019s totally irrational doesn\u2019t make clueyness any less excruciating\u2014something I\u2019m reminded of every time my night is ruined by post-Uber-ride-when-the-friendly-driver-tried-to-start-a-conversation-and-I-wasn\u2019t-in-the-mood-so-I-gave-curt-answers-until-he-finally-got-the-hint-and-then-felt-embarrassed-and-stopped guilt.\nI\u2019m just destined for a life of feeling cluey about things. But at least I can take solace in a little headline I came across recently:\nSad Papaw No Longer Sad: Thousands Wait in Line for Burgers at His Cookout\n___________\nIf you\u2019re feeling cluey right now, three other Wait But Why posts to make it worse:\nThe Tail End \u2013 An intense reality check\nThe Apple Game \u2013 How good a person are you?\nThe Bunny Manifesto \u2013 If this is all a bit

Unless, of course, I do a full post dedicated to those questions. So that\u2019s what this is.\nWhen the last post went out, I asked our email subscribers to submit mailbag questions, and a lot of you responded. I can group the responses that came in into two categories:\n1) Questions whose answers would be somewhere between one sentence and a few paragraphs\n2) Questions whose answers would be somewhere between a few paragraphs and 30,000 words\nThe latter went into my Potential Future Posts List. The former were perfect for the mailbag.\nFor this mailbag, I started with 46 questions and saved the rest for future mailbags. Moving forward, you can submit a mailbag question anytime to [email\u00a0protected].\nOkay let\u2019s jump in\u2014\n___________\nSmooth or crunchy peanut butter? \u2013 James T. (Adelaide, Australia)\nSmooth. I have a jar of peanut butter and sometimes I take a big spoon of it and eat it, and the next 45 seconds of my life is chaotic and upsetting. Crunchy adds another factor on top of that situation, which is the last thing I need.\n___________\nWhat do you think about The Martian? Do you like the book or movie better? \u2013 Scott R. (Richmond, VA)\nBook for sure. The movie was solid and enjoyable, but kind of just another pretty good movie. The book was special. It was one giant thought experiment that explored, \u201cWhat would happen if a super-smart astronaut got stranded on Mars?\u201d and you got the answer to the experiment told through the detailed, inner thoughts of the astronaut. I loved how many technical explanations there were in the book as Watney puzzled his way through problems, and the movie lost 90% of that aspect. In fairness, I read the book first and had no idea what was gonna happen, and I watched the movie without that suspense, so I\u2019m not a fully fair judge.\n___________\nWhat do you believe that not many other people do? (i.e., what are some of your unpopular opinions?) \u2013 Jeremiah O. (New York, NY)\nSaying you\u2019re purely pro-life or purely pro-choice are both inane, for different reasons. A post on this is high up in the queue, so not gonna expand here. But that\u2019s what I think.\nBeing inside is better than being outside in not all but most cases.\nThe longer the plane ride, the better. Plane rides are the best\u2014as long as I don\u2019t have to work or have to sleep.\nGreat music without lyrics is better than great music with lyrics.\nBlack licorice is delicious.\nChocolate is a bad flavor of ice cream.\nAnimated TV or movies are more fun to watch than real people TV or movies.\nWashing your hair every day is a silly thing to do.\nOrdering fish in a restaurant is for people who don\u2019t care about happiness.\n___________\nWould you call yourself a transhumanist? \u2013 Saurabh S. (New Delhi, India)\nI\u2019m not entirely sure what a transhumanist is. Hold on.\nOkay Wikipedia says it\u2019s this:\nTranshumanism is an international and intellectual movement that aims to transform the human condition by developing and creating widely available sophisticated technologies to greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities. Transhumanist thinkers study the potential benefits and dangers of emerging technologies that could overcome fundamental human limitations, as well as the ethics of using such technologies. The most common thesis is that human beings may eventually be able to transform themselves into different beings with abilities so greatly expanded from the natural condition as to merit the label of posthuman beings.\nUh, yeah, definitely. The objectives of transhumanism strike me as the kind of thing a lot of people think is wrong or distasteful or unnatural\u2026until it becomes commonplace. And then people can\u2019t imagine what life was like before and would never want to go back.\nI\u2019m always in favor of getting rid of what\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d for something that\u2019s better. Sleeping in caves is natural, and it\u2019s really great that we found a better way. Riding horses is how humans got around for a long time, and driving cars is a huge upgrade for both the human and the horse. I\u2019m sure people thought the concept of the organ transplant was terribly unnatural before the technology became possible, and now they don\u2019t. So yeah, let\u2019s go for it. I\u2019m not at all attached to the biological body I was born with if we can find a better way.\nThat said, at some point you start running into the question \u201cwhat makes you you?\u201d I\u2019ll upgrade any part of my existence in any way available until it gets to the point where doing so kills me by making me not me anymore. If science can replace my brain with a synthetic brain containing the identical data as my own, with the advantage that it\u2019ll never age, it sounds great\u2014unless I suspect that the new me seems like me and acts like me but I don\u2019t actually have access to that consciousness. When an upgrade gets to the point where it\u2019s essentially creating a synthetic clone of me to take my place in the world\u2014that\u2019s right where my transhumanism ends. The exception might be if I was going to die either way and creating the upgraded no-longer-me clone me can serve people on Earth somehow, like someone creating a clone of themselves so their family doesn\u2019t have to lose them.\nWe don\u2019t know when an upgrade causes you to cease to exist because there\u2019s no clear answer to what makes you you. But we\u2019re a long way from crossing that bridge, so for now, I\u2019m pro-transhumanism.\n___________\nWill you ever finish up the presidents series?\u2013 Jennifer R. (Davis, CA)\u2013 Danielle P. (Arlington, VA)\u2013 Emily B. (Arlington, VA)\u2013 Ron G. (San Marcos, CA)\u2013 Claire L. (Cape Cod, MA)\nI know, I know, and I haven\u2019t forgotten about it. The presidents series will be completed, probably with two more parts, but I don\u2019t have a specific timeline yet.\n___________\nDo you know how to code? Or are you planning to learn it? \u2013 Dawid P. (Sufczyn, Poland)\nNo. But I do know BC Calculus, thank god, because the American public school curriculum was last updated in 1820.\nPart of me thinks it\u2019s a no-brainer time investment to learn to code, but part of me also wonders if we might be in a phase of time when it\u2019s an important skill to have, but then that phase ends. There was a time when it was important for computer people to know how to actually use 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s and now there\u2019s no need for that, so maybe people who are being born now will never need to learn how to code? I\u2019d prefer that narrative, because it would mean A) it excuses me from having to deal with learning how to code, and B) I only made a dramatic two-decade mistake by not learning how to code in college and not a lifelong one.\nI should probably learn how to code.\n___________\nWhy did you decide to buy a tortoise? \u2013 Samantha K. (Singapore)\nIn 2005, I went to the pet store to get a fighter fish because why not have a little screensaver on your desk. When I got there, I walked by a glass terrarium with a golf-ball-sized tortoise in it. I asked to hold him immediately, lifting him up by pinching his shell between my thumb and index finger. His four legs moved back and forth as he tried to figure out why he was suddenly levitating in mid-air. And the decision was done.\n11 years later, Winston and I live happily together. As I type this, he (now the size of a football) is moseying by me, going about his business, living his life.\nI\u2019m not really sure why everyone doesn\u2019t own a tortoise. They\u2019re hilarious entities, they\u2019re unthinkably cute, they\u2019re unbelievably chill and require very little from you, they\u2019re a great party trick when you have friends over, and they won\u2019t expire until your grandkids are in their 80s.\nI mean:\n\n___________\nWhat would you do if you could meet antimatter Tim? \u2013 Treyvon C. (Houston, TX)\nThanks, Treyvon, for sending me on an hour spiral reading about antimatter and what happens when you combine it with matter.\nHere\u2019s the deal. Antimatter is matter made up of antiparticles, which are like normal particles except with the opposite charge\u2014negatively charged protons, positively charged electrons, etc.\nAntimatter occurs very rarely in nature and is incredibly hard to produce\u2014so hard that in 1999, NASA estimated that the going rate for antimatter was about $62.5 trillion per gram. A later estimate in 2006 brought the price down to only $25 billion a gram nbd.\nI weigh about 160 lbs or about 73 kg. So at the cheapest, anti-matter Tim would be worth about $1,825,000,000,000,000 and would be getting mugged constantly.\nBut if he managed to make it intact to a meeting with me, it would be fun to meet him until we shook hands and the Earth blew up.\nHere\u2019s the problem: when matter and antimatter are put together, both of them are annihilated and a lot of energy is released. How much energy? E = mc2 much. That example\u2014a gram of antimatter and a gram of matter colliding\u2014comes out like this:\nE = mc2\nMass = 2 grams in this case, and c = the speed of light in meters/second = about 300,000,000 m/s, so:\nE = (.002 kg)(300,000,000)2\nE = 1.8 x 1014 joules\n1 kg of TNT releases 4,184,000 joules of energy. So our gram of antimatter collision produces an explosion equivalent to blowing up about 43 million kg of TNT.\n= 43,000 tons of TNT= 43 kilotons of TNT= an explosion about three times bigger than the Hiroshima bomb\nAnd that\u2019s a gram of antimatter.\nBack to my hangout with antimatter Tim. He and I each weigh about 73,000 grams, so our handshake would be unpleasant for both of us, blowing us both up in an explosion that releases the same energy as 3.1 million kilotons, or 3,100 megatons of TNT. (A megaton = a million tons = a billion kgs)\nThe density of TNT is 1.654 g/cm3. So a kg of TNT would be about the size of a grapefruit, a ton of TNT would be a little smaller than a car, a kiloton of TNT would be the size of a house, and my handshake with antimatter Tim would be like blowing up a cube of TNT with a side of 1.2 km. Very similar, it turns out, to what I once figured out was the size of the building needed to hold all the world\u2019s humans:\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t quite blow up the Earth, but with an explosion 200,000 times the size of the Hiroshima bomb, me meeting antimatter Tim would be bad for everybody.\n___________\nDo you have any insights as to how one finds their calling? \u2013 Akshat V. (Bangalore, India)\nSay two people want to find the love of their life, Person A and Person B.\nPerson A never goes on dates, opting instead to sit alone debating in her head about who the exact kind of person is she will fall in love with. She scours online profiles, but never contacts anyone. Instead, her plan is to wait until she comes across the profile so perfect for her that she\u2019ll know she\u2019s found The One. Then and only then will she reach out to that person for a date.\nPerson B goes on a lot of dates, constantly meeting new people and keeping an open mind, because she knows she probably doesn\u2019t know either herself or the type of match that makes sense for her as well as she thinks she does.\nWho\u2019s more likely to find the love of their life?\n___________\nCan you suggest [legal] ways to experience Whoa moments? \u2013 T\u00f3th B.\nPsychedelic methods aside, I\u2019d say this:\nThe best way not to experience a whoa moment is to live your days exactly how you normally do. You know how when you brush your teeth, you can think about something totally different and it doesn\u2019t affect your ability to brush? Because it\u2019s all being done by your subconscious? Well living your normal routine day is kind of like that\u2014your brain is mostly on autopilot, and you\u2019re living largely in an unconscious and comfortable groove.\nTo bring heightened clarity and new epiphanies into your life, try getting out of that unconscious groove by forcing conscious thought about things our consciousness doesn\u2019t usually bother with because they\u2019re not important for our daily tasks. I did this recently when I found myself with 15 minutes to kill on a street corner before meeting someone there. Instead of doing what I\u2019d normally do\u2014burying myself in my phone to pass the time\u2014I decided to get into \u201cconscious mode.\u201d I looked up and around me at the architecture, I looked at little details on the sidewalk and the steps of a nearby building, I looked down at my feet and realized it was funny that I was supporting myself vertically on two sticks. And suddenly, everything was weird, and I was having a great time. It was hilarious watching all these people bustling around, all of them on their own two sticks, all of them stuck to the side of a floating rock in space, and none of them thinking about that. Full whoa moment.\nBut the people I was watching weren\u2019t thinking about being stuck to the side of a rock floating in a huge void\u2014they were completely lost in the unconscious groove we all spend most of our time in.\nA whoa moment happens when your conscious mind takes a step back and glimpses reality for a second, which we all have the power to do\u2014we just have to remember to think about it.\n___________\nHave you ever been to Burning Man? If so, how was your experience? If not, why not? \u2013 Sam B. (Kansas City, MO)\nFunny you ask. I\u2019m going this year for the first time\u2014at least that\u2019s the plan (I\u2019ve failed so far at getting tickets). I\u2019ve heard about Burning Man a lot, but it always struck me as something very not me-ish to go to. Without really knowing what Burning Man is, I\u2019ve always just pictured a bunch of people standing in the 120\u00ba desert acting exactly like this woman, except with no stage or music nearby. And what the hell am I gonna do in that situation. Also very unclear why that video has so many views.\nBut over the past few years, I\u2019ve heard so many people say so many fascinating things about it that I\u2019ve become enticed enough to give it a try. Any advice from Burning Man veterans is welcome.\n___________\nWhat kind of kid were you? \u2013 Mia (Uppsala, Sweden)\nI said a lot of words. I actually made what I now realize was the world\u2019s first podcast in 1987 when I was five. I had this little tape-player/recorder and I\u2019d regularly put a blank tape in and press record and say some shit for a half hour. Then I\u2019d write \u201cTim\u2019s Performance\u201d on the tape and give it to my parents to enjoy. At one point, I suspected they were lying about actually listening to my musings, so I tested them by waiting until about 20 minutes into one of my recording sessions and then saying, \u201cThe secret number is 128. I\u2019m going to ask you what the secret number is later, and remember, it\u2019s 128.\u201d I later asked my parents what the secret number was and they didn\u2019t know what the fuck I was talking about. My podcast was not engaging.\n___________\nWhat is one thing that you don\u2019t procrastinate about and why do you think that is? \u2013 Richard R. (Fort Lauderdale, FL)\nI had to think about this for an upsettingly long time to come up with an answer. What I finally came up with is eating my gummy vitamins each day.\n___________\nWhat\u2019s a recent embarrassing YouTube spiral you\u2019ve gone down? \u2013 Jackie V. (Perth, Australia)\nthis > this > this > this > this > this\n___________\nHas your sense of life purpose changed with a newfound look on human mortality? If so, how? If not, why? \u2013 Will H. (Berkeley, CA)\nFor those unacquainted, I believe Will is referring to the fact that I started Wait But Why 100% sure I was going to die somewhere between 2013 and 2100, and then I wrote posts like the Fermi post and the AI post and the Truthism post and the Cryonics post and now I have no idea what the fuck is going on. Suddenly, the prospect of living till I\u2019m an ultra-cranky 1,280-year-old seems perfectly plausible.\nI\u2019m not sure my life purpose has changed because I\u2019m not sure I had a life purpose in mind to begin with. But it\u2019s definitely put me in a better mood about things. An atheist is already at rock bottom when it comes to their personal long-term outlook, so realizing that the world of 2050 might be unrecognizable to us, with totally different rules, is a delightful development.\n___________\nDo you have any recurring nightmares? \u2013 Daniel J. (Cape Town, South Africa)\nYes. About really big numbers. It\u2019s me somewhere, in the shit, while some huge booming voice is telling me I have to do stuff involving huge numbers like a billion and a trillion. It goes all the way back to when I was a kid. I just got the shivers writing this.\n_____________\nWhat are your MBTI results?As one of the many (I\u2019m assuming here) people out there who read snippets of your posts to an unreceptive spouse, I\u2019m wondering if there are clusters of Myers & Briggs personality types that find your writing particularly appealing. So, I would really enjoy the following: (1) Your MBTI results, (2) The results of a survey of your email subscribers, and (3) Your thoughts on the whole thing. \u2013 Preston S. (Oklahoma City, OK)\nFor those unacquainted, Myers Briggs is a famous personality test that labels everyone with a four-letter code. It judges personalities on a set of four binary criteria. As explained by the Myers Briggs website:\nFavorite world: Do you prefer to focus on the outer world or on your own inner world? This is called Extraversion (E) or Introversion (I).\nInformation: Do you prefer to focus on the basic information you take in or do you prefer to interpret and add meaning? This is called Sensing (S) or Intuition (N).\nDecisions: When making decisions, do you prefer to first look at logic and consistency or first look at the people and special circumstances? This is called Thinking (T) or Feeling (F).\nStructure: In dealing with the outside world, do you prefer to get things decided or do you prefer to stay open to new information and options? This is called Judging (J) or Perceiving (P).\nSo one person might be an ENFP while another person might be an ISFJ, and so on. Myers Briggs also lays out the typical characteristics of each of the 16 possible types here.\nThe whole thing seems a little simplistic to me, given how complicated and multi-dimensional humans are. But it\u2019s still fun.\nWhen I took the test, I got an INTP. I was close to the I/E border and the S/N border, while very strongly a T and a P.\nPreston also asked about doing a survey of email subscribers. Let\u2019s just put a survey here. We\u2019ll publish the results on the WBW Facebook page.\n[Update: MBTI Survey Results]\n___________\nDo you have any favorite interesting/educational YouTube channels to watch? \u2013 Christopher D. (New Haven, CT)\nThere are so many good ones \u2013 it\u2019s incredible how easy it is today to have someone teach you stuff in an entertaining way for free while you\u2019re sitting on the couch. Six favorites:\nKurzgesagtCGP GreyVSauceTedEdVeritasiumSciShow\nWould love to hear about others in the comments.\n___________\nWhat are your thoughts on routine infant circumcision, beneficial procedure or human rights violation? \u2013 Beau S. (Brisbane, Australia)\nIf I take a step back and look at this from first principles, I start by looking up whether the procedure is important for health reasons. When I find out the answer is probably not, it becomes pretty clear that circumcision is nothing other than a primitive, religious practice of genital mutilation that for some reason is common today. It makes no sense, and once we all stop doing it, it\u2019ll seem like an absurd custom of the past. I had friends recently go through this decision with their new baby, and every argument went against circumcision except one: not circumcising their son would make him different than most of the other guys in his world in a part of life where being different can be mortifying, especially as either a little kid being made fun of by his friends or an already-sexually-insecure teenager. They went with circumcision. And I get it. But it makes no sense, aside from the fact that we\u2019re all doing it (at least in the US). Can we just all agree to stop it with new babies?\n___________\nDo you like waffles? \u2013 Matt V. (Bartonsville, PA)\nI\u2019ve never understood waffles / pancakes / french toast people. A few bites of that on the side, sure, but if I\u2019m hungry at a breakfast restaurant, I want something that involves salt and tabasco sauce. Ordering those sweet things for breakfast seems to me like ordering cake for dinner.\n___________\nWhat are some of your favorite movies, and what do you think they say about you? \u2013 Joe S.\nAs I thought about the answer to this question, I realized that the movies I\u2019ve liked the absolute most in my life were movies made for 7-10-year olds when I was 7-10. The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Home Alone, The Princess Bride, Back to the Future, etc. Are those movies all incredible, or does this just always happen with whatever happened to be the best movies of your childhood? Not really sure.\nFor movies I\u2019ve seen from the age of 10 onwards, I\u2019ll give some awards:\nMost obvious answer that\u2019s also just really good though: The Shawshank Redemption (Runners-up: Godfather 1/2, Braveheart)\nLess obvious answer that should be more obvious and I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s not everyone\u2019s favorite movie: Shutter Island\nMovie that is considered good but I probably liked it more than most people cause it was exactly my type of fun plot: Memento\nMovie that\u2019s pretty random to put on this list but I just really liked it: About Schmidt\nMovie I thought was only pretty good but then it stuck with me way more than I realized it would and sometimes makes me wonder if I\u2019m Truman and this thing is happening to me and having me seeing The Truman Show was a really intense, fun part of the plot for everyone watching: The Truman Show\nMost fun movie-watching experience even though I wouldn\u2019t really call it a great movie: Ocean\u2019s 11 (Runner-up: Limitless)\nMovie whose first 70% makes this list but not the last 30% because that part sucked: Minority Report\nMovie that I loved and took fully seriously and then saw again with people who were laughing the whole time and realized it was actually a comedy: Being John Malkovich. (Runner-up: American Psycho)\nMovie that\u2019s not considered very good but I actually think it was great: The Invention of Lying\nMovie that might have been great but also it might have been terrible and I don\u2019t know because I don\u2019t know what the fuck happened: Mulholland Drive\nDocumentary that was a terrible experience to watch the entire time but also the best documentary I\u2019ve ever seen: Dear Zachary\nDocumentary that was almost as good and it wasn\u2019t a nightmare to watch: March of the Penguins\nDocumentary that\u2019s comforting as fuck to watch and I\u2019ve seen it three times and there will be more viewings in the future: Jiro Dreams of Sushi\nMovie that I think about every time I see a person yelling things to no one on the street: Requiem for a Dream\nMovie that was incredibly good and also, kill me: Life is Beautiful\nMovie that is objectively pretty great but it also kind of annoys me how \u201ccool\u201d it is: Every Quentin Tarantino movie (Runner-up: Every Stanley Kubrik movie)\nMovie that ruined my happiness permanently: The Ring\nMovie that\u2019s embarrassing to put on this list but sorry it was just really good: Love Actually. (Runner-up: Titanic)\nWorst movie I\u2019ve ever seen: American Wedding. (Runner-up: From Hell. And Dodgeball. And Transformers 2. And Next Friday.)\nOne thing about this list is there are very few comedies. It\u2019s not that I never like comedies\u2014I just think comedy movies are rarely that funny. I can\u2019t think of many movies that can equal the funniness of the funniest TV shows\u2014shows like The Office (UK), Curb, It\u2019s Always Sunny, Family Guy, etc.\nAs for what these say about me? I don\u2019t really know\u2014that\u2019s for Joe to decide.\n___________\nLately I\u2019ve been stumbling into the most frustrating arguments about a ridiculous topic: \u201cThe Earth is Flat.\u201dWell, that\u2019s what a lot of people have been trying to tell me lately and I haven\u2019t been able to convince any of them of the truth. I feel like you would be the best person to break it down and explain how it is just not possible, in a way that they would understand. Anyway, just a request, if you can\u2019t convince people the earth is a globe then no one can. It may sound funny but unfortunately I\u2019m being serious. \u2013 Kennard M. (Antioch, CA)\nFar more interesting than any answer I can give is the specifics of the arguments you\u2019ve been hearing. Please expand in the comments.\n___________\nWhat\u2019s your wpm? \u2013 Kevin B. (Riverside, CA)\nI didn\u2019t know the answer to this, so I tested myself here. On my first try I clocked in at 84 words per minute. On the second try I did 92. And on the third try I did 98. Pleased.\n\nThen it was ruined when I sent it to Alicia (Wait But Why\u2019s Manager of Lots of Things) to try and she got 147 like a psycho.\nAnyway, the site has you type out famous quotes, and an unexpected side benefit of doing this was realizing at one point that I was speed-typing Montesquieu summing up life:\nIf you only wished to be happy, this could be easily accomplished; but we wish to be happier than other people, and this is always difficult, for we believe others to be happier than they are.\n___________\nHas your curiosity ever been a problem for you? \u2013 Mariam C. (Paris, France)\nMy most prominent emotion when traveling in other countries (or in parts of the US I\u2019m not used to) is curiosity. That\u2019s part of why I often pick destinations that I don\u2019t know much about or that seem super different from my world.\nThe most interesting experiences happen when I befriend locals, which usually allows me to get a much deeper glimpse into what life is like in that place than I ever could as a voyeuring tourist. I\u2019ve gotten myself invited into homes, weddings, social events, factories, etc.\u2014and it\u2019s usually a great experience.\nUsually.\nOn one of my solo trips, I was out in the Rio nightlife district of Lapa and met two extraordinarily friendly dudes. They really liked me, so much that they invited me to a nearby house party.\nA random Brazilian house party! I had no idea what a Brazilian house party was like, and I was super excited to find out. Luckily for me, I had found two guys who just really like befriending random foreign dudes and bringing them to parties.\nThen we went to the party, which turned out to be us standing on a silent street a few blocks away from the crowded area while they forcefully took my things and ran away. Interesting party, but they had a better time than I did.\nHilariously, I had taken a selfie with them earlier in the night when we were all still BFFs. It was on a disposable camera, and that was one of the things they decided not to bother taking, so I still have the picture.\n\nKind of funny looking at their faces and knowing now that the smiles were, \u201cOh god yes I think this guy\u2019s actually gonna come with us!\u201d\nOne other example that came to mind is the time I was about 12 and got curious about what would happen if I put my hamster, Waddles Urban, up my dad\u2019s t-shirt when he was lying on his back on the couch sleeping. It was a very bad experience for both my dad and Waddles and a terrific one for me\u2014kind of the reverse of the Brazil incident.\n___________\nWould anything ever change your opinion about the existence of God? Would you discount it as a psychological error or hallucination? Could anything ever prove the existence of God to you? \u2013 Michael S. \nWhy don\u2019t you believe in God? \u2013 Luis C. (Dallas, TX)\nHow can you be 100% sure that there isn\u2019t something deeper to life than the material realm? \u2013 Noli S. (Prishtina, Kosovo)\nWhen it comes to everything written in the Bible, Quran, Torah, Vedas, Guru Granth Sahib, and all the rest, I\u2019m atheist for the same reason I\u2019m atheist about Greek Myths when I read them\u2014they were written by people a long time ago who knew less than we do about the world, not more. No, lightning isn\u2019t caused by Zeus throwing lightning bolts, it\u2019s caused by the interaction of oppositely-charged particles in heavy clouds. And no, ancient rocks and fossils and mountains and canyons weren\u2019t created by a great flood 6,000 years ago, they were created by a bunch of other stuff that happened over the past five billion years\u2014stuff that we now understand. So when it comes to the various gods described in the world\u2019s religions\u2014yes, I\u2019m as atheist as can be. With those gods, the question isn\u2019t \u201cWhy don\u2019t I believe in God?\u201d it\u2019s \u201cWhy would I believe in God?\u201d\nThat said, when it comes to the question, \u201cIs there a higher force or higher being or grand creator of some kind?\u201d I\u2019m entirely agnostic. We don\u2019t even know if we\u2019re alone in the universe or not\u2014as far as we know, there are trillions of superintelligent civilizations out there, with capabilities we couldn\u2019t understand even if they tried to explain it to us (could you explain human capabilities to a chicken?). Could one of them have created life on Earth in some lab? Sure, why not?\nCould it be that it\u2019s common for higher civilizations to create simulations, and if so, wouldn\u2019t that mean that they might create trillions upon trillions of them, and if so, wouldn\u2019t that mean that there are far more simulation civilizations in existence than real ones, and if so, wouldn\u2019t that mean that just by the percentages, it\u2019s far more likely that we\u2019re one of the simulated ones than one of the real ones? Uh\u2026I guess yeah?1\nWe don\u2019t even know what the universe is. It might be one of hundreds or millions or an infinite number of universes, or it might be the only thing there is. It might be a blip of energy floating around in one of the quarks inside one of the atoms that makes up the toenail of a red and blue baby pig bathing himself in a five-dimensional jelly swamp, and it comes into and out of existence in a nanosecond of the piglet\u2019s life since every second in his world is 1010925 years for us. That literally might be what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s as likely as anything else you can come up with.\nSo it\u2019s outrageous to declare anything about the origin of life, the existence of one or more higher beings, or what our place is in all of this other than \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Agnostic.\nAnd when any fellow human\u2014in 2016 or in 100 A.D.\u2014declares that he knows the deal with God, including a bunch of details, I immediately say \u201cNope.\u201d\nI think that answers Luis and Noli. As for Michael\u2014the answer is yes. I know what I know because of the information I have. If new information presents itself to me, it might change what I believe. But even if some rad supernatural shit happened like some woman levitated on the sidewalk when I walked by and then suddenly went shooting upwards through the clouds, I\u2019d be quicker to assume that it was the work of a biological or AI being from another part of the universe, or that we were in a simulation and the beings running it got bored and decided to fuck with me, than I would be to take what I saw as evidence that one of the Earthly religions was true.\n___________\nWould you rather be attacked by 100 duck-sized horses or 1 horse-sized duck? \u2013 Kyle P. (Cheshire, CT)\nI\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about this.\nI\u2019d go for the 100 little horses. Here\u2019s why:\nThe duck would be terrifying. Have you seen how ducks act when you throw a piece of bread in the water? They turn into ravenous psychos. They use their wings, beaks, feet, and anything else they can to violently knock the other ducks out of the way. Then they lunge at the bread with their big hard duck beak. Now imagine a huge duck and you\u2019re the bread. You\u2019re done. That cock will charge at you and try to bite your head off. And you can\u2019t run away\u2014because it can fly. And its beak is still narrow enough that if you try to hide somewhere it can probably wedge its beak in there and pull you out. You\u2019re done. It\u2019s over.\nThe horses would be bad. But not as bad as the duck. Angry horses are pretty angry. And their bite could probably take a chunk out of your leg. Or maybe they\u2019d kick you with their hind legs, which would give you painful little ankle bruises. All of that would be painful, but not lethal. Lethal happens when you\u2019re frantically kicking them one by one and you accidentally fall over. Falling over would be a huge disaster with the little horses. They\u2019d be biting your neck open and kicking you in the crotch and jumping up on your stomach. Done. But unlike with the duck, you could probably escape the horses. You could just climb up on a bench and now what? They\u2019re screwed. They can charge the bench and jump up on their hind legs all they want, but you\u2019re a full foot above their highest jump, and they can\u2019t climb or fly, so you can just lay down and nap on the bench while they tire themselves out. Then when you wake up, you can carefully grab them one at a time and bring it up to the bench and use its tail to tie its back legs together, neutralizing that horse. It would take a while, but eventually they\u2019d all be neutralized, hobbling around on the ground, in the shit with their leg situation, and you could just step over them and walk away.\n___________\nWhy does the atmosphere of the earth circle around the earth? We circle with the earth because we are attached to the ground, but the atmosphere isn\u2019t attached to the ground so why does it circle around with the planet? \u2013 Sinan A. (Baghdad, Iraq)\nYou say \u201cwe circle the earth because we are attached to the ground,\u201d but what does \u201cattached\u201d mean? What it really means is there\u2019s friction between our bodies and the surface of the earth that \u201cpulls\u201d our bodies. The oceans are less \u201cattached\u201d to the ground than a solid human body, but oceans rotate with the earth too, because there\u2019s friction between the water molecules and the ocean floor. There\u2019s less friction between the atmosphere and Earth\u2019s surface than there is in the case of solid or liquid matter on the surface, but there\u2019s still friction\u2014which affects the atmosphere enough to pull it, too, along with Earth\u2019s rotation.\nBut in all of these cases, friction is only why these things initially began to rotate along with the earth. Once something is up to full Earth rotational speed, the reason the atmosphere or anything else continues to rotate with the earth is inertia\u2014an object in motion stays in motion. If the earth suddenly and instantly reversed rotational direction, there would be utter chaos on the surface, and everything would go flying. We, the oceans, and the atmosphere would all still carry the normal rotational velocity and the earth no longer would\u2014kind of like when a moving car slams on the breaks and everything in the car lunges forward. But once the chaos settled down, the rotational velocity of all things on Earth\u2019s surface would eventually be slowed down and reversed to match Earth\u2019s new spin\u2014because of friction. You\u2019d be dead though.\n___________\nWhich are scarier \u2013 horror movies about ghosts or serial killers? \u2013 Layla P. (Mexico City, Mexico)\nGhosts 100%. Serial killer movies make me edgy as fuck when I leave the theater and I\u2019m walking down the street and there are strangers all around. But ghost movies take a shit in a much deeper part of my soul, and suddenly everything in my apartment\u2014a blank white wall, a picture in a frame, a lamp on my nightstand\u2014is terrifying.\n___________\nIf you could pick one future event that you could witness first hand, what would it be? \u2013 Brian G. (Cambridge, UK)\nOn the heels of the recent cryonics post, I might pick the first time a vitrified person is successfully and fully revived.\n___________\nHow do you be a good person? \u2013 Katerena K. (Seattle, WA)\nThis warrants a 12,000-word post, but for now, I\u2019ll start with one idea:\nI think a great way to be a good person is to get in the habit of consciously thinking about the fact that almost every stranger, co-worker, friend, acquaintance, fling, customer service representative, driver, waiter, customer, client, neighbor, and person on the internet you come across:\n\nHas a family who loves them and vice versa\nHas hopes and dreams and regrets and frustrations\nHas as many thoughts going through their head at all times as you do\nIs dealing with random health problems, trying to make ends meet financially, and is probably tired\nMight be supporting one or more other human beings\nMight be just a little sad all the time about a tragedy in their past\nMight be the most important person in someone else\u2019s life\nIs just trying to figure out how to be happy\n\ni.e. They\u2019re a full human just like you.\nRemembering that will make you kinder and more empathetic.\n___________\nWhat kind of thermos is your favorite thermos? Is it a Thermos-brand thermos? What color is it? How old is it? \u2013 Maxfield M. (Sacramento, CA)\nMy sister had a blanket she was obsessed with as a toddler that she inexplicably called her Ninee (like \u201cnight\u201d without the t and then \u201cknee\u201d). If you tried to take her Ninee away from her she flipped her shit. It was a critical part of her being.\nMy thermos is my Ninee. My ideal way to drink coffee is to slowly have one 16-ounce cup of black coffee over a four-hour span. Coffee in an open mug stays hot for like eight minutes. In a covered, paper take-out cup, maybe 15 minutes. Both totally unacceptable. I suffered for my whole life with this issue until I realized thermoses existed a few years ago. I got this one and it solved all my problems, with the added benefit of it being closable, so I can pop a full thermos in my bag or put it on the floor on an airplane (upright in my shoe).\nBecause I\u2019m a child, I lose my thermos by leaving it somewhere about twice a year on average, but at $22, it\u2019s only a little devastating every time it happens.\nI\u2019ve also recently gotten into the small S\u2019well thermos, which I use when I don\u2019t have my bag because unlike my normal one, it fits in my jeans pocket.\n___________\nWhat is happiness? \u2013 Frank P. (Tokyo, Japan)\nReality minus expectations.\nI have a much longer answer, but saving it for a post.\n___________\nWhat do you think about hypnotherapy?A relative of mine who is a very critical thinker recently became a \u201cqualified hypnotherapist\u201d which made me ponder how credible this field is. How does it work? Is it effective? And so on\u2026 \u2013 Matt B. (Leicester, UK)\nI\u2019m pretty sure those absurd stage hypnosis charades with a bunch of \u201chypnotized\u201d people barking like a dog or having an orgasm or forgetting the number two on stage in front of a laughing crowd have to be some combo of people enjoying attention, peer pressure, and some element of placebo effect. No way that can be real.\nBut serious, one-on-one hypnotherapy? Sure, why not? The brain is weird, so why wouldn\u2019t a trance-like state be able to be induced? From what I\u2019ve read, hypnosis is just an extension of the phenomenon of a person getting so wrapped up in a thought that when someone calls their name, they don\u2019t even hear it. That kind of hypnosis seems to be real, though it works on some people better than others and for some not at all. The problem for the credibility of hypnosis is all the fictional, cartoony hypnosis we\u2019ve seen in movies, where the person is a robot who will do whatever the hypnotist says\u2014pretty sure it doesn\u2019t work like that.\nI have a friend who\u2019s been doing a type of hypnosis called EMDR with his therapist and claims that while doing so, a memory of himself breastfeeding flashed in his consciousness for a second. Nahhh, right? Or could it be possible?\n___________\nIn what other aspects of your life do you apply the rationale you use to avoid a Vegan/Vegetarian lifestyle? (i.e. \u201cThis action/choice is indefensible but I\u2019ll do it anyway since it\u2019s 1. enjoyable, and 2. socially permissible.\u201d) \u2013 Ndi S. (New York, NY)\nIf I\u2019m understanding correctly, the question is: \u201cYou\u2019ve admitted that despite knowing how wrong it is to support the torture and brutal slaughter of helpless animals, you do it anyway because you\u2019re kind of a dick. Where else in your life are you kind of a dick in a similar way?\u201d\nGood question. Let\u2019s see\u2026\nI\u2019m typing this on a MacBook Pro made in a Chinese factory of nightmares and suicide.\nI buy plastic things a lot and only recycle them if it\u2019s easy.\nI\u2019m wearing clothes most likely sewn by a melancholy 11-year-old somewhere far away in \u201cLet\u2019s just not think about that!\u201d land.\nI sometimes leave the water running while I\u2019m brushing my teeth even though lack of clean water is destroying like 50% of the world\u2019s happiness.\nI hire unpaid interns sometimes.\nI walk by 15 homeless people a day and give them money only when I have change in my pocket and then walk into a coffee shop and tip the barista a dollar or two even though they definitely have a bed.\nIf I walk by someone\u2019s house and a mean-looking dog is in the yard behind a fence, I bark at him to get him worked up because it\u2019s funny and he doesn\u2019t know how to open the gate.\nI leave my phone on LTE until the plane gets too high to get a signal.\nI sneak down to better seats at the Red Sox game.\nI sometimes sign Andrew up for the mailing lists of fortune tellers and other mystics when I have a few minutes to kill on the internet.\nI cohabitate with a tortoise in a small apartment even though he belongs in the desert.\nThanks Ndi.\n___________\nHow do you choose what to work on for WBW? When you run out of ideas, how do you plan to source new ideas? \u2013 Ricky Y. (San Francisco, CA)\nOne thing that will never be a problem for me is a shortage of post topics. I currently have a 116-page Word document full of topics, thoughts, questions, and random brainstorms I want to make into posts. Whenever I\u2019m in an interesting conversation, or think of a funny observation, or find myself with an intriguing question, I write it in the doc. And if you just get in that habit, the potential-post-topic doc becomes long pretty quickly. To make it into the doc, a topic generally has to satisfy at least one of these:\n\nIt\u2019s something I think people know about and hear about but generally don\u2019t understand\nIt\u2019s something about life we all notice subconsciously but we don\u2019t usually think about it or put it into words\nIt\u2019s something that many of us are feeling or thinking secretly but no one is saying\nIt\u2019s something important that we don\u2019t think about very intelligently because we don\u2019t have a useful framework in our heads, or an important psychological concept that we should have a concrete label for but don\u2019t\nIt\u2019s something I come across that blows my mind and I know it\u2019ll blow readers\u2019 minds too\n\nWhen it\u2019s time to start a new post, I scan down the big doc and pick something that excites me at that time. I get really exhausted by a topic by the time I\u2019m done with it, so I try to mix things up\u2014if the last post was really researchy, the next one might be more brainstormy, or if the last topic was heavy, I might pick something lighter next.\n___________\nWhat Chrome extensions do you use? \u2013 Kyle\nPocket \u2013 to save articles I want to read later or offline\ngoo.gl URL shortener\nThe Great Suspender \u2013 freezes tabs I have open but haven\u2019t used in a while which goes a long way to reduce Chrome\u2019s insane memory burden.\nTabs Outliner \u2013 So when Chrome crashes or I lose my tabs for any other reason I can easily restore them.\nMomentum \u2013 Makes my day 0.5% better every day so why not.\nGoogle Calendar\nHoney \u2013 finds discount codes\nAnother Chrome thing I did once which was very worth the time: I put the 30 or so sites I go to most in the bookmarks bar, but I left each with a blank name, so the bookmarks bar is just a big line of logos. This makes basically every site I ever go to just a button click.\n___________\nWhat do I do if I always feel stupid?There are so many awesome things in our world, e.g. gravitational astronomy, physics of superconducters, neuroscience, genetics, AI, space exploration, math problems, WBW posts. Well, you get it. Much more than an average person could ever learn, I guess. Therefore my question is: what do I do if I always feel stupid? Like, really, always. \u2013 Katie S. (Russia)\nStupid is when you don\u2019t know that much about anything and you feel like everyone else does. The good news is, everyone else doesn\u2019t. At all. The world is full of exciting, complex things that almost no one understands. Once you realize this, all the stuff you don\u2019t know isn\u2019t upsetting, it\u2019s exciting.\nIt\u2019s like reading. I\u2019ve read a bunch of good books, but there are 1,000 times as many that I haven\u2019t read. If I believed that most people had read most books and for some reason I had not, I\u2019d feel embarrassingly not-well-read. But because I know that most people haven\u2019t read most books, I can take my own situation out of the thought process and just enjoy the fact that I\u2019ll never run out of good new books to read.\nSo even though people sometimes present themselves as more knowledgeable about more things than they really are, remember that really, most people don\u2019t know much about anything, and try to get excited about the fact that with every year of your life that goes by, you\u2019ll know more and more and more.\nAnd remember, to actually learn about a topic you don\u2019t get, you have to build a tree trunk foundation of understanding before you can start tacking onto that foundation by adding on branches and leaves (like news articles about recent developments). The thing that makes people feel stupid is trying to absorb branches and leaves when they don\u2019t yet have a tree trunk, so it always goes in one ear and out the other and you feel like it\u2019s hopeless for you to ever grasp the topic\u2014but it\u2019s not.\n___________\nDo you cook much? If so, what is your favorite cookbook (or chef, cooking website, etc)? \u2013 Al T. (Charlottesville, VA)\nCooking some elaborate thing using a recipe is for me like reading fiction\u2014when I do it, I thoroughly enjoy it, but I do it like once a year. Mostly, I keep it to things like stir frying vegetables and rice, which is an excuse to have a condiment/spices party.\nAs for cookbooks, I recently got J. Kenji Lopez-Alt\u2019s The Food Lab, which is delightful so far. Not a big chef fanboy person, although I had a phase with Bobby Flay\u2019s Boy Meets Grill show at one point and I\u2019m pretty infatuated with how cocky and rad Danny Bowien is (the Mission Chinese guy).\nMy greatest culinary passion is whichever 15 hot sauces I happen to have in my fridge at any given time. Currently:\n\n___________\nHow does wind work? What is the mechanism behind wind happening? Why does it happen? \u2013 Steven H. (Cape Girardeau, MO)\nI\u2019ll need to read about how weather works for 30 hours before I can give a proper answer to this question, but I\u2019ll take a crack.\nThe key to wind is air pressure. Forget the atmosphere for a second and take a breath in. What happens? Air from outside your body rushes into your body. Now exhale\u2014and air rushes back out. What\u2019s happening is that the air outside your body is staying at the same pressure level, but when you inhale, you\u2019re increasing the volume in your lungs, which lowers the air molecules / volume ratio in your lungs, which lowers the air pressure in your lungs. Air always \u201cwants\u201d to even things out, so air rushes into your lungs to accommodate for the extra space created by your inhale and equalize the pressure inside and outside of you. When you exhale, you\u2019re decreasing the volume in your lungs, which increases the air pressure to a level higher than the air outside your body, so air rushes out to make things equal.\nWhen the sun heats up parts of the atmosphere, the air rises, which leaves less air down near the surface than normal\u2014a low pressure system. Hot air rising and leaving a void underneath is kind of like the atmosphere \u201cinhaling.\u201d Just like what happens in your expanding lungs, air from higher pressure systems surrounding the low pressure system rushes in to equalize things\u2014i.e. the low pressure area \u201csucks\u201d in surrounding air. In the reverse situation, when there\u2019s a higher-than-normal pressure system in the atmosphere, it\u2019s like a human exhaling. The higher pressure system presses outward into lower pressure areas and the air rushes there to equalize things. That rushing air is what we experience as wind. Wind is just air moving from areas of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure.\nRelatedly, this is cool.\n___________\nI would be interested to know in what position two similar sized human bodies are touching the most. Surface mapping? I would like to create a mathematically correct sculpture. \u2013 Ludescher S. (Vienna, Austria)\nNo idea. But I included this odd question so someone who knows can explain it to all of us in the comments.\n___________\nWhat\u2019s one of the most important life lessons you\u2019ve learned in your years so far that you would give to a young adult/college student? \u2013 Cathy J. (Toronto, Canada)\nMaking really close lifelong friends is a hard thing to do for most people, and it gets even harder once you hit the real world and everyone lives in isolated apartments and spends their days at work. Really close friendships are built by spending a ton of hours with the same person or group of people again and again, and there\u2019s nowhere better to foster that than college or the years after college when people often live with roommates.\nGiven that, one piece of advice would be to first, assess your friendships and figure out who\u2019s in Q1 (here\u2019s a refresher on what Q1 is, from this post).\nThen, invest in those friendships, and remember that lazy afternoons sitting around doing nothing with them might seem mundane, but it\u2019s actually building a foundation of closeness and comfort that you\u2019ll be thankful for later. It\u2019s time well spent.\nAnd if you don\u2019t think many of your friends are in Q1, ask yourself why that might be. Maybe you\u2019re not hanging out with the right kind of people for you.\n___________\nCan you share any advice on becoming a good writer? \u2013 James M. (Dublin, Ireland)\n1) Write. I wrote 300 blog posts between the ages of 23 and 29 before starting Wait But Why. It can take a while to find your voice and your tone and your style. At the beginning, you\u2019ll be all over the place, the same way you are when you try a new sport or video game or musical instrument. That\u2019s good\u2014you\u2019re experimenting on a canvas. Don\u2019t judge your own writing at this phase\u2014you\u2019re experimenting and searching and playing\u2014you\u2019re not doing your best writing yet. If your mammoth is freaking out too much and ruining things, start with an anonymous blog.\n2) Don\u2019t be a complete perfectionist, but don\u2019t settle for writing you know isn\u2019t working. Even if you\u2019re experimenting, if something you\u2019re trying isn\u2019t working, try to figure out why, rewrite parts, start over and try a new approach, etc.\u2014keep fiddling until it clicks. Each time you go through the hard, painful work of agonizing over writing that isn\u2019t working and eventually get it to click, you become a better writer.\n3) Read a lot. It\u2019s like fertilizer.\n4) On one side of the spectrum, you\u2019re completely copying the exact style and even the wording of another writer you like\u2014let\u2019s call that a 1. On the other side, you\u2019re completely unique, writing in a way the world has never seen before\u2014let\u2019s call it a 10. Your goal is to start somewhere in the middle and then work your way up the scale as you mature as a writer. That said, having influences is inevitable and perfectly okay, because true 10s don\u2019t exist. This same concept applies to stand-up comedy, music, or any other type of art. It\u2019s a badge of honor to say The Beatles are one of your influences, but no one likes a songwriter who\u2019s blatantly copying The Beatles. Without getting to a 7 or 8 on the uniqueness spectrum, there\u2019s likely a ceiling on how high your writing career can go.\n5) While you\u2019re experimenting with your writing, keep your mind open to all creative possibilities. The first 290 of the 300 blog posts I wrote in my 20s had no visuals. Only towards the very end did I try drawing something one night. And only then did I realize how much I liked combining hand-drawn visuals with my writing. That could have easily never happened, and if it hadn\u2019t, Wait But Why would be an all-text blog today.\n6) If you get feedback as you grow as a writer, be careful who it\u2019s coming from. The person giving feedback should A) believe in you, B) be rooting for you, and C) be completely aware that what they\u2019re reading isn\u2019t your max potential but you experimenting, gaining confidence, and trying to figure out your voice. A person who satisfies all of those is great to get feedback from. Someone who fails any of those criteria is going to do you more harm than good, and will often be the person who makes you quit prematurely and never try again (even if you don\u2019t realize they\u2019re the reason that happened).\n7) Remember that in most cases, the ideas behind the writing are more important than the quality of the writing itself. You\u2019d rather have great ideas and pretty good writing than the other way around.\n___________\nDo you speak any other languages? \u2013 Ricardo K. (Vinhedo, Brazil)\nI speak 1.43 languages:\n\nEnglish\n40% of Spanish\n1% of French\n0.1% of about 20 other languages because I learned how to say a few sentences when I visited a country where that was the language\n\nMy .4 Spanish capabilities are super useful when I visit Spanish-speaking countries, but mostly when I need to say something to someone. Once I finish, the party\u2019s over. For some reason, my brain decided to not ever learn to understand what the fuck anyone is saying when they speak Spanish to me.\nMy problem is that I never learned Spanish well enough to do that thing where you have a Spanish part of your brain. So instead, I\u2019ve memorized a ton of Spanish words and when I speak to someone, I\u2019m doing what people who are bad at languages do\u2014I\u2019m rapid-fire translating in my head with each word that comes out of my mouth. I\u2019m proficient enough to get around a Spanish-speaking country and even have conversations with people\u2014as long as they don\u2019t say anything back. When they do, it\u2019s like someone throwing five tennis balls at me every second and expecting me to somehow catch all of them. So I go into a panic and just keep saying \u201clentamente\u201d until their pace comes down so far that I can figure out what they\u2019re saying.\n___________\nIf you could eat one non-edible thing, what would it be? \u2013 Tandice O. (New York, NY)\nThe sticky hand.\n\nHow many people have ever lived? \nI have a question I figured only WBW could answer properly. It came up when I took a shower and I thought: \u201cWow, it\u2019s kinda crazy that most people from the beginning of time till now haven\u2019t felt the pressure of a hot shower,\u201d since I guess that showers as we know it were invented only a couple of centuries ago (hot bath doesn\u2019t count). But then I thought\u2026 Is it true? There are approximately 7.4 billion people in the world today, and I think the numbers got that big only recently.\nThis made me ponder: how many people have lived on Earth since the beginning of humanity? What percentage of them lived in the last 200 years? \u2013 Zohar A. (Tel Aviv, Israel)\nI\u2019ve thought about the shower thing before. It\u2019s incredible. Imagine being stranded on an island with only basic tools and trying to create an extended hot shower for yourself. Not gonna happen. A hot shower requires a ton of technology. In the interest of not spending two hours reading enough about the history of showers to be able to piece together an estimate for the number of people who have ever had access to a hot shower, I\u2019ll leave it at that thought for now\u2014though I\u2019d be delighted if a reader would like to figure this out and put it in the comments.\nAs for the number of people who have ever lived, Carl Haub at the Population Reference Bureau estimated in 2011 that about 107 billion people have lived:\n\nI made a chart about this stat once in a post:\n\nOf course, Haub\u2019s or anyone else\u2019s estimate for this is imprecise and up for debate, especially since people aren\u2019t even in agreement about when humans \u201cstarted\u201d. Either way, the fact that around 1/15 of all people who have ever lived are currently alive struck me as very high, considering that the past century accounts for at most 1/500 of the time humans have been around.\nIn the same article, Haub estimates that about 40% of those who have ever lived died before their first birthday and estimates that \u201clife expectancy at birth probably averaged only about ten years for most of human history.\u201d If he\u2019s right, it would mean that 1/10 of all humans age 1 or older who have ever lived are currently alive, and that fraction would become higher and higher as you increase the age. So maybe 1/5 of all 30+ year olds who have ever lived are currently alive and maybe a third of people who ever lived to 60 are still alive. And I\u2019d bet that the majority of people 90 or over who have ever lived are alive right now. All guesses, but it seems logical.\n___________\nWhat do you think about this picture?I\u2019ve been having a social issue over a photo of puppies I found on the Internet. Yes, a photo of puppies. I was bored (and admittedly in the dark playground), so I decided to search \u201cadorable dogs\u201d on Google images. I found the picture and was immediately in love. So, I decided to save it and show my family. I was taken aback when they reacted with disgust. My sister seems to think they look like \u201cugly pigs\u201d and my mother has mentioned that they are too fat to be cute. It\u2019s become a pretty heated debate. You seem to have good judgment, so if you have time, tell me what you think. \u2013 Abigail S. (Hartford, CT)\n\nFuckin shit, Abigail. This is literally what would happen if a human and a dog could breed. And in trying to figure out my thoughts on what you\u2019ve presented to me, I\u2019ve stared at it so long\u2014especially the dog on the right\u2014that I now have no idea what these creatures are. Also, I can only picture them having the same texture and consistency as a Stretch Armstrong toy if you pressed into their flesh. Like I\u2019m picturing their skin being frictiony and rubbery, not anything like a biological creature. I\u2019ve gone through a lot in the last few minutes\u2014too much to really answer your question. If I had to answer, I\u2019d say affection is closer to what I\u2019m feeling than disgust, so I guess I agree with you.\nAnd with that, let\u2019s call it a day.\n___________\nCheck these out
